#### The end of The Crew beta is drawing near and it has been an awesomeÂ weekend. The scale and diversity of the worldmap is amazing en hopefully you can get an idea from my screenshots I made along various road trips. The Crew will launch on 2 December, but I hope there will be another beta before that. Keep a close watch on the Legenddiary Twitch channel for The Crew streams.
