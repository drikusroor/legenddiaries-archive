#### The Iron Horde is upon us in the Blasted Lands and soon we will venture through the Dark portal into Draenor, so we can also kick their asses in an alternate time-line. Most WoW players, including me, cannot wait until the new expansion goes live. I do have one major concern with Warlords of Draenor and the general development of the game though: the focus on end-game content.

Blizzard has greatly improved WoW over the years with features like Dungeon Finder. While the Dungeon Finder is a great time-saver, it has a nasty side-effect. You no longer have to interact with other players to group up, which makes people keep to themselves . On top of that players want to get it over with as soon as possible, because running dungeons over and over again is an efficient way of levelling. So if you join a dungeon-run to have a fun and challenging experience like me, you're gonna have a bad time.

The fact that people can cut through dungeons like a knife through butter, is because of heirloom items. They  makes players over-powered in dungeons for their level and the boost gives them a huge amount of experience from every run. I understand that this is a great solution for those that have seen this older content a hundred times, but the problem is that it interferes with the dungeon-experience in which you get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the bosses, take in the details of every area, read the quests and watch the cinematics. That dungeon-experience I knew and loved  is gone.

Therefore I think the 90 boost is brilliant. Instead forcing perfectly good game mechanics into something else to accommodate fast levelling needs, they create a new option that does not interfere with anything else. Sadly after the first free boost (if you have bought WoD) it will cost you a lot of real-life monies to get another character to level 90. So it will only solve the problem partially as people who cannot afford (or want to spend) another 50 dollars on an already expensive game, will still be running through old content like their subscription could run out any second.

And it is not just the dungeons that makes me feel that Blizzard is too focused on end-game content, the coming expansion shows this as well. Where other expansions had at least one reason to create a new character and visit the old content again, Warlords of Draenor features no new race, class or a world changing event like Cataclysm.

I am not arguing that the 90-boost should be free or that heirloom items should be removed, they server their purpose well. However, faster levelling should not interfere with players who want to enjoy the lower level content and I feel that Blizzard is neglecting this part of the game in their attempts to get people to the highest level. The fact that the new expansion only has 90-100 content shows this also. I myself would love to have a reason to start at level one again, but for now Draenor will have to do.

Do you feel the same, or is it all about the end-game for you? Let me know in the comments!
