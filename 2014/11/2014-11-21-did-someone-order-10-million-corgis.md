It has been 10 years people, ten years of walking around with elves and orcs, levelling gnomes and taurens, killing the most fiercesome dragons, elemental lords and Defias scum and hanging around with friends in Stormwind and Ogrimmar. Some of us have played on and off, some non-stop since 2004 and there are even a few that only joined recently. Whatever kind of player you might be, it is safe to say that Azeroth is a second home for all of us.

This is of course a very good reason to celebrate! So log into the game now, pick up some fine Dwarven Thunderbrew and Stormwind Brie, and look back on your time spend (definitely not wasted) in Azeroth. Not for too long though because your new [Molten Corgi](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=84915/molten-corgi#comments) needs to go out at leasts five times a day and some meals in between.

_You receive a Molten Corgi if you log into the game between November 21 and January 6_
