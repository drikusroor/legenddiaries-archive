Which means that besides having a lot of information about you real life, Zuckerberg will soon also know everything about your virtual life and sell it to marketeers. Not that it is all his fault, we all agreed with his terms and conditions and will probably continue to do so.

The real problem however, is that the Oculus Rift is a Kickstarter project. Almost ten thousand people invested a total ofÂ $2,437,429 into the virtual reality headset. These people invested in something that they wanted, made by people they believed in. It is not that this is going to change immediately now Facebook bought it, but someone else is going to be overseeing the creation of this hardware and more importantly: is going to profit from it.

This means that those that invested in the project, indirectly invested in something that would become part of the company of Mark Zuckerberg. As one of the pledges of the Kickstarter projects (who also happened to have made some game named Minecraft) wrote on [his blog](http://notch.net/2014/03/virtual-reality-is-going-to-change-the-world/):

> ###### I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition.

This is the dark side of Kickstarter. Once you pledged your money to a project, it is a donation and the people can do as they like with it. If the project is not completed or not living up to your expectations, your money will be wasted. In this case, you can even end up investing into a company that you really dislike.

Notch is [not the only pledge](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/comments) who is disappointed by the news. The question is, will it have consequences for Kickstarter? Will people be more reluctant to donate money or will they support interesting projects anyway? Let me know what you think in the comments below.
