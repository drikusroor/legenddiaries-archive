Lego and games go very well together as has been proved in the past. I myself played a lot with Lego before I had access to games and I am not the only gamer that has that connection with Lego.  Last year for instance, we got to see a Minecraft lego set which [you can now actually order.](http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Minecraft-21102)

Today I came across this Age of Empires II set, which is not actually available in stores but awesome nonetheless. I doubt that it will ever get produced but it is a very nice idea.

'The Artizan' as he calls himself, has combined Age of Empires with legos in a formidable way. He has made The barracks and several other buildings as well. You can check those on [his Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/21569129@N04/sets/), just as some other Star Wars lego sets. Enjoy!

 Have you seen other interesting Lego sets based on games? Let me know in the comments!
