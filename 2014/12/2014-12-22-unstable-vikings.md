#### Back in the day Vikings were nearly always bad news, but now that most Vikings are virtual I was really [looking forward](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/valhalla/) to Viking Conquest.

It seems though that the people from the Brytenwalda mod have not delivered (yet). The game is very unstable, buggy and has performance issues. Most [Steam reviews](http://store.steampowered.com/app/321300/#app_reviews_hash) are very negative because of this and tell us to hold off on Viking Conquest for now.

Hopefully it will get some heavy-weight patches soon so I can give the game a fair review.
