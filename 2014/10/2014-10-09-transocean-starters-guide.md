**TransOcean - The Shipping Company is a new tycoon game. Most game mechanics are pretty straight forward but it can be challenging and overwhelming in the beginning and especially the campaign mode can be frustrating. So I have written a beginners guide to get you started.**

#### Off to a good start

Your new shipping company needs an Headquarters  and you must choose its location carefully. The most obvious choice is a major port like Rotterdam, but those do not give any bonuses. If you start at a smaller port you will have various discounts and bonuses on contracts, fuel and tugging costs. These smaller ports often do not sell the larger ships, but you do not have to worry about that. When you are able to afford Panamax or even larger ships you will have established on or more subsidiaries around the world already.

#### To dock or not to dock

Also important is choosing an HQ in a port where it is easy to manoeuvre your ships around, because in the beginning you will save precious monies with docking your ships by yourself. Some contracts have a profit margin of only $150.000, which will disappear when you have to spend $200.000 on tugging fees.[![TransOcean 2](images/TransOcean-2.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/TransOcean-2.jpg)

Docking can be difficult though and if you wreck your ship and to pay an even higher tugging fee. If this happens often it is better to just pay the tugging fee. From my experience leaving a port is easier than docking your ship, so if you have difficulties with this avoid the latter and just handle the departures yourself. When you get about 5 ships or more it is often no longer necessary to do the docking yourself, if you pick the right contracts.

#### Load her up

You should always look for the appropriate contracts and fill up your ships as much as possible. Often the most valuable contracts may not result in the most profiting trips. For instance a single cargo of 1,2 million to one port is less profitable than three contracts of 500.000 for two different ports. Also the first port you visit might have other contracts for your final destination which will make the trip even more lucrative than when you would have taken the 1.2 million contract.[![TransOcean 4](images/TransOcean-4.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/TransOcean-4.jpg)

If you find one of your ships in a harbour without any interesting contracts, check if your ship needs repairs. If it does, repair it and while you wait the contracts will be refreshed. The same goes for upgrades. The only reason for picking a bad contract is if it unlocks a port you have not visited yet. Especially in the beginning when you want to unlock the world map this might be worth a single trip with some financial losses.

#### Fuel prices

From my experience there is no golden rule in managing your fuel. When you go as slow as possible you will save on fuel costs, but if you go full throttle you can do more contracts. Sometimes you cannot let them go full throttle because of the distance, but often you can and the time you save can make up for the fuel costs. That is if you pay attention to fuel prices. St. Petersburg, Valancia and New York for instance have often very low priced fuel. Planning your route carefully so you can fuel up at these ports can maximize your profits. It goes the other way around as well, avoid fuelling up at ports like Rotterdam if possible.

#### Sign here please

I already talked about single contracts, but there are also bigger contracts that ask you to take a certain amount of particular goods from one port to the other. These are a bit trickier but can also bring you much more profit. This is not because of the bonus you get for completing the contract, but because of the amount of single contracts it triggers. When you have to haul product X from Hamburg to New York, there will be at least five single contracts available at any time during the contract. This means that you should go for goods that have a large profit margin. For example antiques, with which you can make more money than timber wood.

Another thing to consider with these contracts is chaining. It depends on the contracts available, but if you can; try to make a contract circle. For example: Cars from Hamburg to New York, metals from New York to Dakar and Ores from Dakar to Hamburg. It is a big risk taking on so much contracts on at the same time in the beginning, but if you can create a chain like this it will be done in no-time and you can rest on a big pile of beautiful monies

Be careful with contracts in campaign mode though, since your lovely investor will throw random undo able contracts your way for which you will need every single ship at your disposal to complete it on time.

I hope this helps and if you have suggestions or further questions let me know in the comments
