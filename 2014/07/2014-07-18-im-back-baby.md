#### It has been a while since I posted. In the beginning this was because of my study-load but later on I was struggling with continuing Legenddiaries at all. Which I almost did not. Almost, because after some reorganizing and revamping I am ready to continue this blog for the foreseeable future! Below my reasons, changes and plans for Legenddiaries.

In June I made the decision to stop with this blog and start a whole new one in Dutch. That did not go so well. I just could not get it to a point where I was satisfied with it, so after a month of struggling with my new blog I decided to give up and instead reorganize Legenddiaries. I fired all staff members and hired new fresh people. I speak for myself when I say that they are all very excited.

The main goal of starting a new blog was to focus completely on Dutch. Therefore I have implemented a separate Dutch category with similar sub-categories I have made in the English department. That's right we have departments now.

I have made 3 + 1 categories: blogs, previews/reviews, special features and stories where I have parked our favourite Milkdrinker for now. Blogs will offer more personal opinions and experiences. These posts will be similar to what I wrote in the  Monthly Diaries, which will be discontinued for now. Previews/reviews is pretty straight forward. In special features you will find reoccuring features like Nostalgia or special themed pieces.

There will not change that much except for the additional Dutch posts. The front page will still be English and as long as you stick to English Features, you will not have to read one Dutch word! I hope you will continue to read Legenddiaries and comment on my posts.
