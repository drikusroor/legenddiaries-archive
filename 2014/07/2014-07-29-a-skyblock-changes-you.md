#### I have not played many custom Minecraft modes or maps so far, because I believe that a normal survival game is as fun as Minecraft gets. Skyblock however, had something very appealing to it. In hindsight I am not sure why.

I spawn on a small patch of dirt high in the Minecraft sky. Clouds pass by underneath my small chunk of blocks. To my left is a tree and behind me is a small chest. Beyond my block in the sky there is nothing to see but the square sun in the distance. You can almost feel the thin air that normally surrounds you at these altitudes.

The chest contains the standard set of items that are essential to succeeding in my survival in the sky. I look at the tree. This is no ordinary tree that you start punching immediately after you spawn in a Minecraft survival game. This tree is a beautiful branch you must grab and hold, since it is the key to your survival. Or in less romanticized words: make sure you grab every log and especially every sapling, or you will die.

This goes for everything  on your island in the air, except for yourself. You as a player are the only thing that will not be missed when you fall into the abyss. And you will. You will miscalculate and step over the edge, pick a block that was the last thing between you and the nothingness below or throw yourself over the edge because you cannot take this extreme survival any more.

Your adventure will not necessarily be over when this happens. You can simply teleport back with /home, without your items of course, or start a whole new island.  But you will see that something has changed. You are now afraid, afraid of falling, afraid of making another misstep. You will cling to your shift key, so you cannot fall and if you get close to the edge or make a near misstep you will have a small heart attack every time.

Only when you manage to expand your Skyblock, with one cobblestone from the generator at a time, your feeling of security will slowly come back. After playing Skyblock I have a new found respect for trees, seeds, water and other resources I normally take for granted.

A Skyblock will change you. But I can recommend it to anyone who likes to take survival to the next step. You can play this mode on the [official Skyblock server](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/maps/1473433-surv-skyblock) or a server that has this mod installed.
