#### One of my favourite features from Pokémon X/Y is Wonder trade. You trade a Pokémon through the network and you will get a mystery Pokémon in return. Through this system I have acquired all the starters, rare Pokémon I did not caught yet and Pokémon exclusive to Pokemon Y that I can not catch in my X game.

I have also received lots of less interesting Pokémon like Bunnelbys and Magikarps. This can be frustrating when you have carefully selected Pokémon to trade through Wonder trade and in return you get the first Pokémon every trainer catches within the first 30 minutes of the game.

It is at those moment I am not sure what to do. Do I trade it back into the system until I get a Pokémon I want? Or do I just release it to uphold some standard for trading through Wondertrade?

The idea behind this is that if I trade Pokémon people might want or is a possible addition to their Pokédex, they might uphold the same standard and the system as a whole improves. Because if you don't, it is like downloading a torrent without seeding afterwards. Like the golden rule says: One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.

So I have to resist the urge to throw back the Magikarps back into the ocean of Wondertrades until I get a Pokémon that I like, because it will ruin the system. Also because proverbs are always right.

I take my Pokémon bussiness way to serious and so should you! Do you hate these Bunnelbys breeders as much as I do or are you actually one of those wretched people that leech of the Wondertrade system? Let me know in the comments!![magikarpright](images/magikarpright-150x150.png)
