I do not play a lot of games on my phone, but Flappy Bird might be the biggest hit since Angry Birds so I could not resist to try it. Of course I got frustrated like everyone else and decided that I now officially hate all birds (this includes but is not limited to: flappy, angry, flying, sandwich-stealing and noisy birds). I deleted the game from my phone, since I was not getting further than "high" score 2 and lived happily ever after.

Then my mother texted me about a new game she was playing: Flappy Bird. She said she was not very good at it but that it was rather fun. I asked about her "high" score and waited anxiously. What followed is one of those moments that your psychiatrist will later define as a 'traumatic',"I got to 8!" So I downloaded Flappy Bird again and went at it until I would hit 9. I was euphoric when I hit the magic number 3, and then realized I had a problem.

Then the most wonderful news came through to me, [the maker of Flappy Bird is taking it offline](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/08/flappy-bird-creator-to-take-game-down-tomorrow). This would solve everything! Now all I had to do is delete the application from my mothers phone. Then time will do its work and everybody will have forgotten that my mother and those stupid birds beat me at a game.
