In this first giveaway on Legenddiaries you can win a Humble Bundle! For those that are unfamiliar to the concept: [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) is a website that sells games in bundles for which you can pay what you want and you can choose to give part of the money(or all of it) to a charity. The current Humble bundle has 5 games in it, all from the great Sid Meier himself. Well actually from Firaxis Games, but he is so kind to put his own name on every game he releases. I guess when your games are really epic you can get away with that.

A very nice selection if you ask me and I therefore urge you to head over to the Humble Bundle [website](https://www.humblebundle.com/) to go buy these yourself! But if you're even more broke than I am, then all you have to do is leave a comment below and tell us what you think the best game in the bundle is and why! The winner will be picked by a biased jury consisting of one person (me) and will announce the winner on the 20th of February.

#### UPDATE: Since there were 2 participants I decided to roll a dice to decide who is the winner. Congratulations Michel! You will find the link in you inbox soon. I thank you both for participating and reading Legenddiaries!
