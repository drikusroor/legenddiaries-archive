#### In 2013 Alexander J. Velicky released his mod Falskaar for Skyrim that he had been working on for over a year. He wanted to show Bethesda what he could do, hoping they would consider hiring him. While he has not landed a job at Bethesda, the kind people of Bungie (you know the one that made Halo) took him into their ranks. Not bad for a 19-year-old. Below you find my experience in Falskaar. \[including some minor spoilers\]

I started with a fresh character and roamed the forests of south-east Skyrim for a while as a mercenary. On a ordinary day I heard about some rumors of bandits in a cave nearby Riften and decided to check it out. What was supposed to be a simple kill-the-bandits-and-get-payed job turned into a adventure which would take me away from Skyrim so long, that it would feel almost alien when I would return.

I arrived in Falskaar unintentionally and was plunged into the problems of the people of Amber Creek. The people, who are all voice acted, are kind and asked humbly for my help. They call me 'the traveler' and I was soon running around the forests of Falskaar completing quests. I was so busy that I almost forgot to notice the beauty of the place. The island which presumably lies somewhere of the coast of Skyrim has a warm and wet climate and is one giant forest. If the hot springs near Amber Creek were not haunted, this would be a great vacation destination.

After running through the forests for about a week I was wondering why I would ever want to leave this place. Sure there was a war going on and bandits were roaming the country, but still Falskaar is definitely not as hostile a place as Skyrim is. And those issues could be dealt with easily, I am the Dragonborn after all. Before I could finish that thought I was sucked into the story again and did not think about it until after the very interesting plot.

The mod is the best quest content I have experienced in a Skyrim mod thus far. Except for one or two funny voice actors and somewhat chaotic battles I did not notice much difference between the vanilla Skyrim content. [](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Falskaar.jpg)

I almost feel sad that I have to return to the cold and hostile environment of Skyrim and be troubled with dragons and vampires again. Maybe I will go back to Falskaar once in a while, to get away from it all.
