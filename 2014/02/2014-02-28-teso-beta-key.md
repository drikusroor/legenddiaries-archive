This weekend another TESO Beta session will commence and I get to invite a friend! Sadly I do not have any, so you I decided to give it to my readers. Since I do not have that many readers either there is a good chance that it is all yours if you are reading this.

Let us know in the comments if you have succesfully claimed the key, so others do not have to waste time trying. Have fun in the beta!
