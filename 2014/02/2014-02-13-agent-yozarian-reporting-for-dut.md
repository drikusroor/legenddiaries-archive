#### In 2012 I tried Ingress for about 15 minutes and then I got annoyed from all the walking and my inaccurate gps signal. Since it is out of beta since December 2013 and because several of my friends are really enthusiastic about it I decided to give it another try.

I re- installed the app, and discovered that I had chosen the Resistance side in the conflict.  This should not be a problem because it does not change anything gameplay-wise, except that all my friends had joined the Enlightened. This resulted in very awkward and hostile situations, because every time I took my phone out of my pocket my Ingressing friends immediately took out theirs and check the portals in the area to make sure I was not attacking anything. So I appealed to the nice people at Google to switch me over to the Enlightened side because it would have had severe consequences for my social life otherwise. It took 6 weeks before they switched me, but last week I could finally start my Ingress adventure.

Ingress is an augmented reality game. It is basically a darker-looking Google Maps which shows portals instead of nearby pizzerias. These portals are located near monuments, statues or exceptional architecture. You can hack these portals from which you get experience and items. With these items you can capture and occupy portals and items with which you can fire at portals. The two factions try to capture and hold as much portals simultaneously and link them with each other to create mind control fields. Pretty serious stuff.

Since the portals are located at places in the real world there is a lot of walking involved in this game. Which is not that bad because I did not get this much exercise since Wii-tennis came out. I play it on my usual route to class or work and often take a d-tour when I see a portal nearby. Also taking a walk is not as mundane as before. The funny thing is that  after playing Ingress for two weeks I know my neighborhood better than I did during my childhood, when I still played outside. So this game has a really nice exercise and get-to-know-your-neighborhood- factor.

A more negative side-effect is that after a week I got very suspicious of other people. While walking around hacking and attacking portals I started to see other Ingress agents everywhere. Anyone who was walking around while looking at his phone (which is pretty much everybody these days) was a potential threat. Also when I was not playing, while cycling for instance, I saw potential portals everywhere. I was suddenly very aware of various statues and monuments that could be portals. The suspicion has faded a little bit now that I realize that not that many people actually play Ingress.

It is pretty much like a never-ending Risk game and can therefore get very boring. Also because you level very slowly so that is not an incentive to keep playing either. However, there is a huge community around each Ingress faction. Good chances are that in your area several people are communicating and even meeting while playing Ingress. These meetings range from item-farming to complete planned operations to take over a city in one day. This is were Ingress gets really interesting and is taken further than just a game of who gets bored first.

Ingress is no game for quitters or people who have a phobia of going outside. If you are neither you will find Ingress a great game to play on your usual commute or Sunday afternoon walks in the park. If you are willing to join the great Ingress community, which is not hard because they will try to pull you in, you can meet some great people as well. I had a great time "playing-outside" for the last two weeks and I believe that I will be serving the Enlightened for some time to come.
