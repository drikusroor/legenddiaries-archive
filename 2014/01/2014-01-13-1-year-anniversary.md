Today it has been one year since my first post on Legenddiaries. I came up with the idea to start a blog somewhere in the middle of 2012 but didn't have the guts to actually do it until the beginning of January of 2013. I had little expectations of it and thought I would give up quickly. While not everything went according to plan or exactly like my initial ideas, I must admit the whole project has exceeded my expectations.

I expected to slack off in the first couple of months and that I would quickly lose interest in writing posts, like I do with many things. surprisingly enough I did not. There were moments that I did have little or no inspiration, but those were only short moments. In whole of 2013 I wrote 75 posts. That does not mean it was all very easy to do. Like I said there were moments without inspiration for new topics and finding time beside studying, working and let's not forget gaming, can be challenging.

Keeping up a sort of quality standard is no easy task either. Especially in the beginning I was focused on posting 3 times a week rather than posting posts that I thoroughly checked and edited. So I reduced the number of posts and focused more on writing quality pieces, that I was satisfied with. Also writing in English was a greater challenge than I expected and I still have lots of work to do on that front.

Creating a blog is a lot of tweaking, trying and failing. It might have come your attention that I dropped my stories about the Mildrinker in Skyrim. Just like I changed the name of the regular feature 'Nostalgia' 3 times. (and I am still not satisfied with that name) While things like these seem minor, a lot of thought goes into them and the result can be very satisfactory but sometimes it feels like a waste of time. While I did not think it often, things like this made me consider quitting blogging altogether.

My biggest challenge however was, and still is, the lack of feedback. While I am surprised by the amount of visitors in the first year (over 10.000) I got little feedback and/or comments on my posts. While I write this blog mainly for myself, it would be nice to know where I stand and if some of those 10.000 viewers actually read or like my posts. Improving readers participation is therefore still one of my biggest goals at the moment.

Although this might sound pretty negative I greatly enjoyed blogging so far. When I look back on what I have written and created on this blog up until now I am very satisfied with the result. I will therefore continue through 2014 and hopefully overcome some of the challenges above.

I thank you for reading my blog in 2013 and hopefully you will stay with me in 2014!
