**2014 has begun and I am already late with my first posts and this Monthly Diary. So without further delay I will review December so we can begin a Legenddiary 2014!**

### Torchlight II

As I told you in the post about the Steam Autumn Sale I bought Torchlight II. It is a hack 'n slash action RPG which has a lot of similarities with Diablo. Especially with Diablo II, which is not surprising since the people behind the Torchlight series are devs who worked on the second Diablo game from Blizzard. Most people who did not appreciate the direction Blizzard took with Diablo 3, liked Torchlight II better. With its cartoonish graphics that made me think of WoW, loads of mobs, challenging bosses and an alpaca as a pet, this is one of my favorite games of 2013. With the emphasis of 'my' because it was actually released in 2012. Most people probably already played it around this time last year, but if you are even slower than me go check it out now, preferably co-op.

### Pokémon X

The reason why I bought a 3DS this summer was the upcoming release of the new Pokémon games. Unfortunately I did not have the time to play it untill the very last weeks of December but it was definitely worth waiting. The first 3D Pokémon game is more complete that all its predecessors. Of course it still has its flaws, there are moments the console clearly has trouble with the 3D effects in the game and there are more than a few other issues. However I spent over 60 hours in Kalos in a period of two weeks, from which I conclude that Pokémon X (and I guess Y as well) is pretty awesome!

### Legenddiaries in January 2014

In my first post of 2014 I want to look back on my first blogging year and share my plans for 2014 with you. I also want to review the gaming year 2013 and my expectations for 2014, but since I have several other posts about specific games in qeue as well, I might skip the games overview since there are already so many of those out there. Hopefully my next posts in January will come to you without much further delay, which is to say every Friday morning of the week!

I wish you all a happy 2014!
