#### The release date of Warlords of Draenor is coming closer and closer. This is also reflected in the beta which has now almost all new character models implemented. I thought this would be a good time to check out the new faces of my three main characters and see if I can still recognize them. First up my lower level Draenei Monk.

I really like how my Draenei looks in WoD. Not only is his face much more expressive and detailed, his body has some nice changes as well. As you can see fits his tabard a lot better and is the male Draenei fiercer than ever.

Next up is my Human Death Knight Nabonidus.

I already disliked my DK's visual appearance, which is why he always wears a helmet. His new face is not better than the old one, but it is not really bad either. The hair is a bit strange, but luckily I will be able change that at the barbershop. In the end it does not matter that much for this character, I just hope WoD will bring us some awesome plate helmets. And maybe a gym, because is appears that all human males have gained some weight...

More important is the model of my main Glatho, a Night Elf priest.

From all my characters I dislike my main's new face the most. With the old model I was going for an older, wise, slightly confused Night Elf. The WoD model looks less old and it a appears that he has not slept since The Burning Crusade came out. That would also explain why he looks a lot crankier than before, which is not something I can really relate to.

There have been a lot of positive reactions to the new models in general, but now that people see the changes to their own characters the excitement of some has become discontent. Which is to be expected when a character you have spend so much time with changes to something that you can no longer relate to. There have been several discussions about giving everyone a free character customization when WoD comes out, so people can at least change their character to something they actually like. For now Blizzard has only confirmed that the new models can be switched off, but that's not really a solution to the problem in my opinion.

Have you seen your new character model yet? If you do not have acces to the beta you can also check your new model [here](http://www.wowhead.com/list). Let me know what you think about it in de comments.
