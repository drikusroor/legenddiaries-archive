#### It has been a while since we looked back on a game that I played when I was still young and innocent, but now the time has come to check out Need For Speed Most Wanted. I wanted to check if it was indeed as good as I remembered or that it was puberty and an overdose Fast and the Furious films that made it so awesome.

First I would like to clarify that I am not talking about the most recent Most Wanted game from 2012, but the awesome one from 2005. The successor of the Need for Speed Underground games, which combined the tuning elements from those games with the police chases from Hot Pursuit. The Most Wanted game you played to be just as cool as Paul Walker in The Fast And The Furious. Or actually 2 Fast 2 Furious. Not that Paul Walker was not just as cool in the first film, but the tuner scene in the first film was quite different. It was still young and dominated by Japanese tuner cars; the only muscle car in that movie was the one from Vin Diesel's Dominique Torreto's dad.

Therefore 2 Fast 2 Furious is more likely to have inspired NFS Most Wanted or at least the second part of that film. Unlike Need For Speed Underground, races take place inbroad-daylight and the cars are no longer Japanese brands only. The three starter cars you can choose from reflect the rest of the car-park of Most Wanted perfectly: a Lexus (Japanese) a Dodge (American) and a Fiat (European). The star of the game is the BMW M3,  but make no mistake, this is still an American game about the American tuner scene in a fictional United States.

The story is pretty thin, but I do not think anyone ever played a race game for its compelling story. After your first race with the M3 you lose it to a rival and on top of it all the police arrest you. [Mia](http://ilarge.listal.com/image/825987/968full-need-for-speed-most-wanted-screenshot.jpg) picks you up from the police station and 'hooks you up' with a new ride. You are back at the bottom of the street racing scene and will have to work your way up again.

I picked the Fiat Punto and started roaming the streets of Rockport. The city is clearly from 2005. Not that it has such distinguishable surroundings, but the world graphics are definitely from a decade ago. As are the cars riding around the city, and do not even get me started on the parked cars, because those gave me some [Midtown Madness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Madness) flashbacks. The cars you drive are really not that bad though, I was expecting far worse and especially if you crank up the resolution (on PC), they look pretty cool. There are about 40 different cars in the game from 21 different brands.

The most important thing is the racing itself of course. Cruising at 120 mp/h through the city ,that you unlock as you advance in the game, which is great. There are different zones which vary between downtown, suburban and country-side areas. The race events come in the usual modes: circuit, sprint, knock-out, drag, time-trial and speedtrap races in which you have to pass speed cameras as fast as possible. The only thing that I really mis here is drifting. The fact that you can win the pink-slip of a rival's ride makes up for that though. Nothing feels better than driving the ride of someone you have just beaten.

The goal in Most Wanted is to become the most wanted racer in Rockport. In order to do that you have to take out blacklist leaders and rise in reputation on the actual blacklist of the police, in which they keep track of the street racers. You gain reputation by completing racing events, but for every blacklist challenge you also have to complete certain goals in police chases. This can be a certain duration of a chase, number of police cars wrecked or amount of damage caused during the chase.

This is in retrospect where Need For Speed Most Wanted took a wrong turn. As a street racer going out there and deliberately starting a police chase seems wrong. Also causing as much damage to the surroundings as possible or other civilian cars in order to advance, seems out of place. I remember that when I was fifteen I thought the police chases where becoming annoying when you advanced further into the game. Now I think it's a bit of a game breaking experience, at least for me personally.

In spite of the dominant police chases it is still an awesome tuner race game. You can customize your care and make it look unique to your preferences. The Fast and the Furious feeling is definitely there and in the end that is what you are looking for when playing these games. Most Wanted took me back to 2005 and does that still very well and it is not just nostalgia that makes this a very good game.
