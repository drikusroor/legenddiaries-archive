**My absence in August was due to the fact that I was travelling through China. While the trip itself was not game related, I did have a look at what China has to offer for gamers.**

#### Horror stories

Most games that come from Asia, or consoles for that matter,  are Japanese and before I went I had no idea what defines gaming in China. Of course you have the stories about Chinese gold farmers and guys who died after playing games for 7 days straight, but not much more than that. So I did some research and was horror-struck by what I found. Chinese gamers mainly play MMO's that are made in China and they all look like Maple Story, not really cutting edge. Besides that they have little to no access to stuff like Steam because of the Great Fire Wall. And on top of all this: there is a console ban! I should have gone to Japan, but since the trip was already booked and my friend was getting married there, I sort of had to go to China. Well let's focus on the positive then. China still has arcade halls and game cafés! Establishments The Netherlands sadly lacks.

#### The arcade hall

[![IMAG1024](images/IMAG1024-193x300.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMAG1024.jpg)So I went looking for said establishments and the arcade hall was the first thing I found. I remember these from the ninties and that I was rarely allowed to play. In China several malls still have them and they have a wide variety of games. You can play games for children with lots of colours, ponies and funny sounds. There are of course the arcade racing seats including a steering-wheel and pedals and let's not forget the arcade fighter games like Tekken at which the hardcore arcade gamer can be found. And if you go further to the back you might find some Tetris and Pacman if you're lucky.

While I found the arcade hall a lot of fun(I could finally play without needing my mom's permission) it was definitely not that popular among the Chinese. The place was deserted on a Friday afternoon during the big school holiday, while it was raining outside. Two Tekken players with a big bowl of coins next to their seat, seemed like the only regular players there. This was definitely not the place where most Chinese gamers hang out, maybe I would have more luck at one of the numerous game cafés that China ought to have.[![IMAG1020](images/IMAG1020.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMAG1020.jpg)

#### Game Cafés

After two weeks in China I still had not seen one game café or internet café for that matter. It could be that I was looking in the wrong places, but they were definitely not that numerous as they once were. The first one, I found on my way back from a night out at 3 o'clock in the morning. It was the only place which still had some lights on and when I had a look inside there were about fifteen guys all in their twenties playing League of Legends. It was exactly like the stories I read before I went, a sad place were no one looks up when you enter and all that seems to matter is the game they are playing. The only reason that they were doing this in a public place instead of at home, was probably because they cannot afford a pc of their own since they do not have job, which is also the reason for them being able to play games at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Thursday.[![IMG_4897](images/IMG_4897.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_4897.jpg)

The next morning I wanted to go back to the place to experience this game café vibe myself, but I could no longer find it. It might have been because I had a few to many beers the night before or that there were now 6 million Chinese walking the street, but I looked like I had to go looking for another one. After some back-alley exploring I finally managed to find one and was surprised to find it full of teens who made lots of happy noises.

In contrary to what I had seen the night before, was this a place were the local youth hangout after school and play games _together_. Some of them were playing LoL as well, but these kids were clearly playing together and had lots of fun while doing it. I tried to play some games myself as far as the Chinese menu would allow me and 90% of what I could decipher or play were multiplayer or massive multiplayer games. I actually felt kind of sad that I did not have one of these places when I was fifteen. My gaming sessions with friends often involved just one computer or on rare occasions my dad driving me and my computer to a friend's house for a weekend. It would have been much easier and more fun to go to a public place and play for a couple of hours before going home.

Gaming is often seen as an anti-social activity and sometimes this is indeed what it is. I myself can be quite the hermit when an awesome game has just released. A game café could be  is a great way of making playing games a more social activity. It would be great if there would be more game cafés and not just in China. I cannot understand why there are so few at the moment.

#### Buying games

While I was very excited about my game café experience, I almost forgot that China was still the country with a console ban. I realized that during my first three weeks there I had not seen any game stores at all. There were lots places that sell toys, but you cannot buy any games there. It was only after I asked some local friend of mine, that I was able to find a place where they sell game-related stuff.

We went to a big mall with 6 stories and within there was nothing but electronics. This was not a normal mall though. For one, there were no stores in it. It was more like a big market place where on every floor there were around 50 individuals selling stuff. No official brands, big chains or game stores are present here. This is because it is actually not allowed. Everyone knows it's there and the police will not shut the place down any time soon, but it was definitely not business as usual.

Playstation 4, Wii-U and even the Xbox One were all available here. Imported from the United States and sold for a slightly increased price. Also older consoles, game pc's and games were sold here. Some more real than others. While this might sound pretty bad, it was kind of cool. Everything a gamer would ever need was sold in one place. The price is a bit higher then we are used to here, or a lot higher without haggling, but it is not like the Chinese gamer is not able to buy the current gen or the latest Need For Speed game.

#### Gaming Holiday

While the game cafés where a lot of fun and the not-completely-legal-electronic-store has everything a gamer could wish for, China is not the best country for a gaming holiday. Luckily there was also lots of other stuff to do there, but I will not bore you with those trivialities.
