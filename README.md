The previous nostalgia game I wrote about was [Scarface,](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/grandpas-golden-oldies-scarface/) which was indeed as fun as I remembered it. This time I like to go further back and look at a game from 1996. The only game I played before that is Freddy Fish and everyone knows that Freddy does not need another look  to know that it is awesome.

- [The Kickstarter funding deadline of [Comic ConQuest](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1314540505/comic-conquest-a-party-based-tactical-rpg) was yesterday and they have received $22.699 from backers which means they have surpassed the initial funding goal! So it is time to look at another project that needs funding. Well 'need' is not really an accurate description since [RimWorld](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tynansylvester/rimworld) already  received over $160.000(CAD) from backers which is a far more than the goal of $20.000.  This means that this Kickstarter campaign is already successful and hopefully the game will be too and if not, it will not be because of lack of funds.](./2013/10/2013-10-24-kickstarter-rimworld.md#the-kickstarter-funding-deadline-of-comic-conquesthttpwwwkickstartercomprojects1314540505comic-conquest-a-party-based-tactical-rpg-was-yesterday-and-they-have-received-22699-from-backers-which-means-they-have-surpassed-the-initial-funding-goal-so-it-is-time-to-look-at-another-project-that-needs-funding-well-need-is-not-really-an-accurate-description-since-rimworldhttpwwwkickstartercomprojectstynansylvesterrimworld-already--received-over-160000cad-from-backers-which-is-a-far-more-than-the-goal-of-20000--this-means-that-this-kickstarter-campaign-is-already-successful-and-hopefully-the-game-will-be-too-and-if-not-it-will-not-be-because-of-lack-of-funds)
