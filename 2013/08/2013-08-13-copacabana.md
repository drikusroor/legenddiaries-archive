Ameland is an island in the [Wadden Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadden_Sea), which I recently visited on a Holiday. Ameland does not have a tropical or "Copacabana" atmosphere, but I did came upon a little house that was named 'Copacabana'. Naming your house on Ameland after something that brings up images of hot summer nights, a blue sea and white beaches , might be a bit optimistic since the nights are always cold and windy and the sea is something between grey and green.Â Even-though it's not Havana and has no night club named Copacabana (Actually it has no nightclub at all) Ameland is not all bad, I even got a little bit of a sun-tan.

Getting back to this summerhouse; it was really small and was made out of white-painted wood with turquoise details. I cannot describe why but I could not stop thinking about it when I got back. I was not able to make a picture so I tried finding one on the internet when I got home, but there was no Copacabana to be found on Ameland.

Then I remembered that in high-school I often made replicas of buildings I came across in real-life. Since I still have a lot of spare time due to summer-vacation, I decided to give it a try and make a house inspired on this Copacabana summerhouse. Also a perfect opportunity to give the Island Paradise expansion another try.

I might have overdone it a little bit with the turqiose but I think I have captured the vibe of the summerhouse I saw pretty well. In any case it is a good place to let my sims escape the resort-managing-madness for a little while, until they get mad from all the turquoise.
