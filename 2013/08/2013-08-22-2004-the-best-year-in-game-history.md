2013 is becoming a pretty decent game year if we look at releases. The most important are probably the two next-gen consoles, but also a lot of good games have been or will be released. Rome Total War II, Pokemon X and Y and GTA V are just a few examples. Since I am pretty psyched about most of the upcoming games I wondered if this could become the best year in game history thus far.

I did some research on game releases per year and came to the conclusion that this is definitely not the best gaming year ever, even if I would count the console releases. The best year game-wise is without a doubt 2004. That year brought us Half Life 2 (yes its been that long), World of Warcraft, GTA San Andreas,  Halo and [the list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_in_video_gaming) goes on and on. You can like these games or not, but they were milestones in game history without discussion.

GTA was already a notable series but San Andreas was triple the size of previous GTA games and had way more missions, rpg elements, character customization and so on. Halo was revolutionary because it made FPS fun and playable on a console. Some say World of Warcraft is in its decline because it has "only"  7 million subscribers left. But if 9 years have past since it's release and 7 million people still pay 15$ a month to play this game I think little can be said to deny World of Warcraft's success.

The games are probably not the best games thus far. A lot of other games have been developed over the years with better graphics and most of them better game play. Skyrim for instance beats the games of 2004. This is however an unfair comparison since there has been so much development between 2004 and 2011. Looking at each game in its own time is difficult, which means declaring 2004 as the best year in game-history is a bit of a challenge.

The fact remains though that a lot of the games from 2004 are still my all-time favorites. I still play GTA San Andreas and World of Warcraft. I also played way more Sims 2 (yes also from 2004) than the Sims 3.  It could all be because I am nostalgic about these games from my teenage years, but they also have to be very good if I still enjoy playing them so much after 9 years.

There is however another reason which makes 2004 at least a remarkable year in game-history. If you compare the list of [2004](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_in_video_gaming) with that [of 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_in_video_gaming), one must notice that there are considerably less releases in 2004. 2012 has a lot of good releases too, but not more than 2004 even though there were fewer games released in total. Which makes the fact that there are so many outstanding games in 2004 even more impressive.

### **Conclusion**

My statement about 2004 is of course very subjective, because nostalgic feelings and game preferences have influence on this statement. However, one cannot deny that the games of 2004 have had a big influence and are still pretty good games after almost 4 years. Also the amount of releases per year have increased immensely, but the number of outstanding games per year have not or at least not as much. Let me know if you think 2004 is the best year in game history or think it should be a different year.
