Normally I am not a big fan of browser games because they always ask you to invite your Facebook friends and are just mundane time-killers. I mean, I have spend a lot of time planting strawberries, milking goats and baking cakes in a certain Zynga game, but just because there wasn't anything else to do. Â Last week I needed some time to kill so I clicked on some ad of a rail tycoon like game.

I signed up for this so-called Rail Nation and made an avatar and all that. Then I had to choose a city from which I would operate and was happily surprised by the fact that cities had dutch inspired names like 'Snaak' instead of 'Sneek'. Through a tutorial I was introduced to most aspects of the game and earned my first train engines. I set-up some nice routes and watched the cash flow in. Rail Nation draws a lot from games like Railroad Tycoon and Sid Meier's Railroads but also from other browser games like Farmville. Like other browser games you have to wait at a certain point for more money and upgrades to be completed. However, no Facebook friends are needed to be successful in this game.

The game has a strong social aspect though. You can form or join an association, which is basically a cooperation, with whom you can invest in businesses and level-up your city. If you have a big and strong association you have a big advantage over the lone wolves. As a beginner it is hard to join one because you have nothing to offer them. So I started my own association: UnoxLever and invested a lot in one business which meant another company was missing out on bonuses because I kept them from become the main shareholder. This caused losses on their part which made them contact me, which resulted in me talking myself into their association which gives me a lot of benefits and help as a new player. A cool development and I am eager to see what we can accomplish together.

I have not seen all that Rail Nation has to offer yet, it is surprisingly deep and complicated. If you like trains and economic strategy games you should definitely try this surprising browser game.
