Is there such a thing as too many games? Well probably not, but that means I do not have enough time. I currently have no studying to do and I only work two days a week. Which means I have more free-time in the next few weeks than I am going to have the rest of the year. So that brings me back to the conclusion that I really have too many games I want to play.

**A short list:** Pokémon Soul Silver ( because I have never finished a second generation Pokémon game), Arma II, Star Wars of the Old Republic (I really want to know what will happen next you my marauder),  Sims Paradise Island, Zelda Orcarina of Time, Mariokart 7, Gary's mod, Dragonborn (I still have to kill that dragon-soul-thief Miraak), Saints Row, The Cave, Little Big Planet Karting (Becoming a Playstation Plus member was a great idea -.-') NHL '12 and probably a couple more.

So I should set some priorities, maybe pick one platform? or pick one for every platform? But what do I do about unexpected coop opportunities?  Those take a lot of time and are sometimes not the games I would like to play the most, but LAN is always more fun.  I could probably postpone playing a few games, but I also have to consider upcoming releases which will not allow me to play these. So what should I do?

Some of you might consider this nagging or think I am spoiled or think I should care about actual problems like world peace or who will win the next Euro Songfestival, that's fine. To the more understanding people: please let me know if you ever had this dilemma and how you coped with it.
