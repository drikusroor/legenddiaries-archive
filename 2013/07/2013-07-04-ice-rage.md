Since I tried NHL I am sort of into hockey. So I checked the playstore if there were any simple ice-hockey games for tablet and I found Ice Rage.

Ice Rage feels like a classic airhockey game with ice-hockey gameplay and visuals.Â  Even though I prefer free games on my tablet, because I do not play on it that much, I was easily convinced to buy Ice Rage after seeing the trailer.

There are three gamemodes: quickplay, a tournament mode and rage mode in which you can win when you body-check your opponent a lot. The tournament mode is very short and not so different from quickplay. Rage mode is different though and also the most challenging from my experience.

The best thing about this game is the multiplayer on one screen. You both hold a side of the tablet and play against each other in a top-down view. The sounds you hear when you body-check the person who sits across from you, are very satisfying.

It is not like you will play this for days, but it is fun to do a match, which are about 2 minutes, every now and then. For 80 cents it's a good game. Even if you do not like ice-hockey\* the multiplayer is fun for everyone.

Ice Rage is available for [android](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ice-rage/id481028647?mt=8) and [apple](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/ice-rage/id481028647?mt=8) devices.
