#### Last week I got The Cave through my new Playstation Plus membership. Since I can only recommend playing this I urge you to stop reading and download The Cave immediately. Then call one or two friends to come over, because you will need them.  When that is done, continue to read about my experience with The Cave and my couch until they get there. What has my couch to do with The Cave you ask? Well I do not want to spoil any of the challenges you will face in The Cave, which talks by the way, and therefore I will use the real-life adventure with my couch as an example.

The hill billy wanted a new couch for their man cave and consulted with the knight about this. Although the knight had other priorities, something about very big sword, he consented. Thus a couch needed to be found, which was not that hard because everything is on the internet. The couch would be delivered that same day so we called our friend the time traveler to assist us.

In the pictures the couch looked like a nice 2-sitter which would perfectly fit next to the couch we already owned. However, since this is not a mundane story about a normal couch we were horribly misled. The couch was gigantic, enormous even and our man cave is not. But before we would be troubled with fitting it into our living room we where challenged by two staircases and a very small doorway.

![Couch met Time Traveller](images/Couch-met-Time-Traveller1-209x300.jpg)With the power of the knight and the insight of the time traveler, we [pivoted](http://youtu.be/yJYH4lO6Bug?t=2m27s) the couch up the stairs in no-time. Apparently it was less heavy than it looked so we had good faith we would be sitting on our new couch very soon. If only our doorway was not so small that would have been true. Whatever we tried the couch would not fit through our doorway. The ceiling was to low, the hallway to narrow and frankly after 2 hours we were too tired. Dave would have to spend the night outside.  (Yes we named the couch in a desperate attempt to get him to cooperate with us by being friendly)

The next day the knight had to work (it is a very ordinary knight) and the time traveler was... well I don't know what he does in is own time, but he wasn't around, which left the hill billy. Since the hill billy isn't the brightest he figured he could saw the couch in half. So he opened the front door where Dave was still standing; he survived the night.

The hill billy looked around the couch to see if he hadn't overlooked anything before he would get the saw. Lucky for him and Dave he did overlook something, the armrests of the couch were separate parts that were connected with six allen screws. If he could unscrew those and remove the armrests, Dave would fit through the door! So instead of getting a saw the hill billy went to the hardware store to find an allen key. He bought a whole bunch of them and after staring at the beautiful check-out girl for half an hour he went home to see if he could disassemble Dave.

Of course it was not the right size allen key. So he had to go back to the hardware store, find the courage to approach the cute check-out girl and ask for a 3.5mm allen key. Unfortunately they did not have that size and since other hardware stores were closed by now, he had to wait for the next day and leave Dave outside one more night.

The next day an allen key 3.5 was found, this time with the help of the knight whom is not that interested in check-out girls which made it all go much faster. With the power of the knight, the patience of the time traveler and the hill billy suggesting every five minutes that 'we should just break it', it took only five hours to get all the screws loose. Dave was taken inside and reassembled, we could finally play The Cave, to face a whole series of other challenges.
