**It dates from 1979, so it is definitely retro enough.  As some of you might have [read](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/cycling-doping-free-since-2001/) I am a huge cycling fan, which means I was watching the Tour de France most of July. When I watch the tour I always get the urge to play Pro Cycling Manager, but since I already wrote about PCM earlier this year I think this is a good time to talk about the best cycling board game out there:  'Demarrage!'.**

### Homas Tour

A friend of mine discovered this game in a closet in his aunt's house while we visited on a holiday. It was from 1979 and called 'Homas Tour'. By reading the description I was skeptic because I did not think cycling would translate very well to a board game, I was wrong.  A lot of tactics and mechanics of cycling are present in this board game. You can form a train, sprint for extra points, escape during a climb and win or lose the yellow jersey.

### **Demarrage!**

We played it for a whole week during the summer and after we went home I looked on the internet to buy it myself. Unfortunately there were almost none for sale and the ones that were, were very expensive. This was because of a fire in a warehouse which left only 20.000 copies for the market, which makes it a fairly rare board game. So it seemed like I had to wait for my friend to visit his aunt again. Lucky for me I have friends who are more persistent than me, because they found a board game just like 'Homas Tour'. Turns out that after the warehouse fire a remake was released under a different name. Demarrage is exactly the same except for the name and the layout.

### Game mechanics

You can move riders by rolling the dice or play a 'demarrage card', which means you can move a rider with a maximum of 12 steps without rolling the dice. These cards are often the keys to a victory if you use them right. Every rider has two of these cards and your team leader has four, because he is supposed to be the strongest. The reason why  démarrage is so important is that normally you can follow the rider in front of you. This means actual trains (or with a bit of imagination; a peleton) can be formed and that you can profit from lucky dice rolls of your opponent. By playing the démarrage cards you can actually escape from these trains because the riders behind you are not allowed to follow.

### Homas Tour Fan(atic)s

While I was looking for the Homas Tour edition after our holiday, I stumbled upon several fan-made projects. The first project is a digital game of Homas Tour. It is all very basic, but if you want to see what this game is about you can [download it](http://users.telenet.be/wielerbordspellen/spellen/spel09/Homas_Tour_XP_1.5.zip). However, it is a lot more fun to play with friends around a table. I also found some pretty impressive fan-projects where an actual 3d model of Alpe d'Huez was created and a 'pro' version of the game was developed.[![Alpe d'Huez 3D](images/homaspro_3D_2.jpg)](http://www.cyclingboardgames.net/g_homastourpro.htm)

I am not planning to go 'pro' anytime soon but some of my friends have come to regret giving me this game, since I try to play it with them on every opportunity I get. If you like board games and are a cycling fan, you are going to like Demarrage!
