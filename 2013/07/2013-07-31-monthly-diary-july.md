**July is over which means I am half-way through my summer vacation. The weather was actually too good to be sitting inside and play games all day, without feeling guilty but I did  not let that feeling get in the way. As a summer tradition I picked-up a Pokémon game and I am currently at the 6th gym of SoulSilver. I also managed to finish-up some lose ends with my Skyrim character and had some awesome LAN-sessions. I also watched the most exciting Tour de France I have seen so far and played [my favourite board](http://www.legenddiaries.com/regular-features/retro-demarrage/) game because of this.  Just like in last month's diary I talk about a few notable things in detail and about my plans for next month.**

### Cube World

In the beginning of July Cube World popped up on almost every game-site, mainly because of its link with Minecraft and all the colors. It takes a lot from Minecraft but instead of building and digging, you explore and kill things. It has rpg and crafting elements that WoW players are familiar with but has a more Diablo kind of combat style. With the cute playable races, monsters and only "happy"colors this game falls into the  category: 'omg-this-is-so-cute-I-want-to-buy-this-now'. Unfortunately you cannot, because the website is under [constant DDoS attacks](https://picroma.com/blog/post/6).

The game is still in its alpha phase but if you compare it to the Minecraft alpha, it is a surprisingly complete game. I will not bore you with all the details because you can find a nice [overview](https://picroma.com/cubeworld#overview) on the website of Cube World. While it is a very enjoyable game in it's alpha phase, we have to wait on how it will be developed. The fact that you cannot build at all (although pre-set player homes are planned) is something that this game cannot go without in my opinion. Cube World just screams for custom-built castles where you can hoard all the crap you find on your adventures. Another concern is if the two developers can pull this project off by themselves. They turned down an offer from Mojang to develop the game further from their offices. Since the project is probably to big for just the two of them I hope they will expand in some other way, otherwise it will be a long time before we can play Cube World how it was meant to be. Nevertheless a very impressive project thus far, one I will be watching closely.

### Managing the game budget

The past months I have been kind of spending too much money on games.  I did not (want to) see this as a problem, but things like having [too many games to play](http://www.legenddiaries.com/other/too-many-games/), not going on an actual holiday or not having a drivers license even though I am 23, made me realize it would be better to maybe spend a little less on games. So with that in mind I set July as a month I would spend nothing on games and just try to focus on the games I already had.

Unfortunately I could not foresee what was coming for me in July: Steam Summer Sale. Only one week into July and I had to alter my recent resolution; I would allow myself to spend €20. So I looked carefully and focused on coop games, since me and my room mate had recent coop dry spell. The result: ARMA II, Operation Arrowhead and Borderlands 2 for less than €18. I have not played Borderlands that much yet, but ARMA with its expansion and the Dayz mod are awesome.

I do not expect to spend less than 20 euros on games next month since I still want to pre-order GTA V. Also a Pokémon pre-order incentive has been announced which does not have to mean anything, except that I find game card holders that look like a Pokéball pretty awesome.

### LAN till dawn

One of the things that made me a gamer is playing coop games over LAN with friends all night long. Starting after diner, not going to bed around my usual bedtime, getting almost too sleepy to continue around 3am and then seeing the sun come up around 6am while still gaming, is one of my favorite things in life. Only a few things (like being the first one to dip into a new peanut-butter jar when the surface is still smooth) can top a LAN till dawn. When I was in high-school this happened almost every weekend, but since I started studying I can only do this during the summer vacation. So last week I sat down with my room mate for a classic Civilization coop-game, which are very long and are perfect to forget the time and just go on and on.  I hope to have several more sessions like these before school begins in September.

### August

![gamescom2012](images/gamescom2012-300x193.jpg)One month of vacation left in which I still want to beat the Pokémon league in SoulSilver, defeat Miraak (which I had planned to do 2 months ago), ride horsies in Minecraft 1.6 and try  get some sun as well. (although that does not have the highest priority)  The most exiting thing for August is that I might attend a game convention for the first time in my life, which I will probably write about excessively if all goes well.
