We all knew it was coming closer, in the past months most gamers turned every cent they spent twice because they knew it would have great repercussions at the end of November. At the 27th of November the Steam Sale started and great casualties were sustained on the first day.  As the dust settles and the smoke clears after December 5th, the damage to financial well being of pc-gamers around the world becomes clear.

I myself am a victim too. I could not resist the amount of discount offered. I first bought the game I planned to buy: [Civilization a Brave New World](http://store.steampowered.com/app/235580/), but soon after that [Silent Storm 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/254960/), [Cities XL platinum](http://store.steampowered.com/app/231140/) and [Age of Empires II HD + the Forgotten Expansion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/). While I do not regret any of these purchases, they did hit my wallet pretty hard.

There is one more title that I bought and deserves it's own paragraph: [Torchlight II](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200710/). I somehow missed the first Torchlight but after recommendation of several fellow gamers, I finally tried out Torchlight II for its reduced price. I am only near the end of act I and know I will not wait for a Steam Sale to buy Torchlight III. It is a hack-and-slash rpg which borrows a lot of game mechanics from Diablo II. Except for the story, everything in this game is perfect. Especially in its most enjoyable game mode: Co-op.

If the rumors are true another sale will be held from the 19th of December. Economy specialist predict that 30% of the households world wide with one or more Steam accounts will go bankrupt within 5 days after the 19th.
