**This monthly diary is late as you might have noticed, for which I have the best excuse there is: I was busy playing games! I did not post much either because, while I was busy playing games my study made sure I would not have the time to write about them****. So with the end of the year coming close, there is still much to write about and many games to play.** 

### Legenddiaries in November:

**[Retro Bobby](http://www.legenddiaries.com/other/retro-bobby/)**

**[Let's talk about balls](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/lets-talk-about-balls/)**

**[Nostalgia: The Movies](http://www.legenddiaries.com/features/nostalgia-the-movies/)**

**[Craft the World: starters guide](http://www.legenddiaries.com/other/craft-the-world-starters-guide/)**

### **Craft the world**

I bought this game on impulse because it looked like [Caveland](http://www.legenddiaries.com/features/grandpas-retro-games-caveland/). Turned out to be a good impulse since I ended up playing with these dwarfs for a week. The early access is still rough on the edges and there are some game breaking bugs, but it is already an amazing game. Also very challenging, which is why I wrote a starters guide to help you the basics. I look forward to future updates and will definitely write a full review when the game is officially released.

### Sims Into the Future

I was a little bit disappointed with the University expansion and I did not care for the Island Paradise content either, which is why I had little hopes for the latest expansion: Into the Future. While longing for the release of the Sims 4 I decided to give Into the Future a try and I was happily surprised. The new technologies, Plumbots, meeting descendants and even changing the future are only a few of the many new features in Into the Future. While Island Paradise had features like resort management that felt kind of alien to the game, Into the Future content blends almost perfectly with the rest of the Sims 3. Although I still long for the Sims 4 to have a fresh Sims experience, Into the Future will keep me occupied for a decent amount of time.

### December

As my plans for December, tomorrow I will post something about the Steam Sale but I have no further plans beyond that. I do have a new weekly deadline for myself where I strife post every Thursday morning, but I am not sure I will meet it every week. So just make sure to check Legenddaries every week or make it easy for yourself and like [Legenddiaries on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Legenddiaries) to get up-dates. All for the low cost of your general interest in games.
