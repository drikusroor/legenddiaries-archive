#### The yearly award show VGX was hot-topic last week because it was poorly executed in almost every possible way. [Joel Mchale made](http://legenddiaries.tumblr.com/post/69468039134/joel-mchale-handles-awkwardness-in-the-vgx-show) it durable for some people while others say that he made it even worse. Everyone agreed on one thing though: the show was rubbish. There was however one more reason why VGX was a hot-topic: the announcement of a game by Hello Games.

Their project No Man's Sky was revealed to the public with a trailer. At this point I would tell you to watch the trailer and see for yourself what this new game exactly is. While the trailer is very interesting the chances are that after watching it you will still have no idea. If you do, please tell me because I certainly do not.

So what is this game about? It's clearly a Sci-fi game in which you get to fly, fight and explore through space. This does not cover everything the game features, but that is what is clear from the video. Everything else remained mystery, but luckily the developers did several interviews which reveal a little bit more (emphasis on 'a little bit') about No Man's Sky.

Exploration seems to be one of, if not the most, important things in the game. This is because when you explore and discover something, you also create it at the same time. This is how it works: you discover a planet and you get to name that planet. At the moment you have done this, the planet will exist with your name for other players ass well. While it is not a multiplayer game, the galaxy the players explore is the same and is procedural generated. This galaxy is going to be gigantic and it will probably take years before everything is discovered/generated, if that is even possible.

The developer Hello Games is also responsible for [Danger Joe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GSAJBXwEbI&list=UUGKx5XhGuf09VERiw_QIemA). There are only four guys working for this studio, which makes No Man's Sky an even more ambitious project. In an interview with Sean Murray and Grant Duncan, [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/12/10/interview-no-mans-sky-and-procedural-generation/) got some more information about what this game is and what it is not. While it can be can compared to Minecraft, Dayz, Dark Souls and Eve Online, No Man's Sky is as different from those games as it is similar.

So it remains unclear what No Man's Sky will be exactly. It all looks very impressive though and this is definitely one of the games you should keep an eye on in 2014.
