**So far I only liked Monte Vista as downloadable neighborhood because of its Italian theme. I did not expect myself to be interested in another neighborhood, but Midnight Hollow got my attention. The new neighborhood for the Sims 3 has an unusual appeal.  The moody looking place had something of Godric's Hollow and the Diagon alley from the Harry Potter movies. On top of that the trailer claimed that you could have a store and sell stuff in a way that looked like the Sims 2 expansion: Open for business.  At that point I was pretty much sold.**

Midnight Hollow is not so much a magical place as it is a place for weirdos. The freaks who are not welcome anywhere else are welcome here. With the lack of sunlight the mix of pale looking people and the fair amount of magical creatures like werewolves walking around, this is an odd place to live. So I decided to create a new Sim, rather than exposing one of my Sims from my long lasting dynasty to this all. Karina Ascania from a ancient Russian family moved to Midnight Hollow because she wants to become a Pokémon Master, but her father will not allow it. Therefore she left and settled among the freaks in Midnight Hollow, to find friends and lots of Simoleons.

After moving into a small house with depressing wallpaper, Karina went around town looking for a place to set up her business. Since the only businesses for sale are over 100.000 Simoleons and Karina's funds were pretty much depleted after breaking the bonds with her family, she had to make some money as a fortune-teller first. After a weeks hard work she has just enough to build a tiny shop at the edge of the shopping center where she started selling some basic furniture.

The shop-keeping-business is not as extensive as it was in 'Open for business', but it is fairly profitable. Especially since the people seem to buy your stuff no matter how high the pricing is. Also hiring someone to managing the shop while you go about your normal business is completely free! So while Karina is making money by telling people they will either find the love of their lives or die this week, someone else is ripping off people in her shop, voluntarily. Not sure if this is just how business is conducted in Midnight Hollow or  if it is a very flawed gameplay mechanic.

While Karina is certainly enjoying here new riches and freaky friends, the shop-keeping-business is not as fun as promised in the trailer. Then again it is not a full expansion pack for the Sims 3, so I should have expected this.  The neighborhood itself is very freaky though, and Karina nor I do regret moving here for the time being.
