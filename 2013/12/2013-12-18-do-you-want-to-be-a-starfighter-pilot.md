Of course you want to be a Starfighter pilot, I was just being silly with the title. What is not silly is your chance to become one in not one but TWO games in 2014.

If you are a decent Star Wars fan you have heard of the widely unpopular, but very decent MMO game: Star Wars: The Old Republic. This MMO has an exciting new feature in which players can finally experience galactic space battles. Linear space missions were already part of the game, but while the idea was OK, the missions were very dull.Â The new galactic star battles will able players to engage in pvp dogfights in space. For subscribers this feature is already live, preferred players and freeloaders can activate their plasma guns in the beginning of 2014.

If you want to skip the whole MMO thing, you might be interested in the recent announcement by Disney Interactive. Star Wars: Attack Squadrons is supposed to be released in 2014 and is going into beta in the first quarter of 2014. Further details will revealed in the coming weeks, but you can get an idea of how the game is not going to look from the trailer with no in-game footage below.
