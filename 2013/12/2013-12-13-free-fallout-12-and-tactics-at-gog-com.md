If you are fast and you check Legenddiaries everyday (or any of the bigger game-news websites) you have the opportunity to get Fallout 1, 2 and tactics [for free](http://www.gog.com/promo/fallout_series_giveaway_winter_promo_2013)! GOG.com who focus on selling older games DRM-free over the internet, offers these games for free for 48hours (only 27 left at the moment of writing this).

You only have to create a GOG.com account, free of charge of course. The chances are you already have an account, because GOG.com is ranked second in the digital pc-game distribution market. I am however new to this platform and although I find it not as user-friendly as Steam, the prices and catalog are not that bad.

Let me know what you think of this offer and your experience with GOG.com so far in the comments.
