It has been almost a year since we played D&D for the first time. We played D20  a modern version of D&D in a 30's - 40's setting in which the players had to catch Heinrich Helmund(a made up German officer pre-WWII that was represented by a Smurf). We promised each other that we would soon continue the story and catch H.H but that plan failed horribly because we never had time to prepare another adventure. At the end of the summer we finally had the time to meet up and prepare a new adventure but since it was so long ago since we played d20 and we had a few new players, we decided to play the original D&D this time.

The adventure I chose was Rescue at Riverroar. I thought by using a standard adventure it would save me a lot of preparation time. Well it turns out that if you play an official adventure you also have to know all the official rules, especially if you are the dungeon master. After reading the most important parts of the three player-handbooks, the dungeon master guide, the monster manual and the adventure itself I felt like I had started a new year at the (D&D) university.

In preparation I also had to draw levels, walk through the encounters and buy ogres which all took up a lot of time.  Since I knew from our earlier game it was totally worth the effort, I did not mind. Unfortunately the players did not have as much time and could not prepare their character properly. Which delayed the start of the game and the game itself. Every time somebody wanted to attack or use a skill they had to look it up in the handbook, so the two encounters which were supposed to be easy took over 5 hours.  This was also because I didn't know everything either and I made mistakes like forgetting the initiative order.

Even-though the game did not go very smoothly, everyone had a good time and wanted to play again. That is the thing I like about D&D so much; you do not have to be a gamer or a total nerd to enjoy it and even when everything is not going as planned everyone is still having a lot of fun together. Hopefully we will be able to play again soon and if we do I will write more about the story and characters that we are playing.
