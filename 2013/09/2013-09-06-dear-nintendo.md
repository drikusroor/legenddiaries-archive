I was not going to write about the 2DS. It is evident it is ugly and the only people who are going to buy it, are those who have kids that destruct everything they touch and at the same time will not stop crying until they get a new hand-held. Good job  for attending to that specific group of costumers and now move on to a more sensible project.

This were my thoughts on the 2DS until the beginning of this week and  I was not going to say these things out loud. This has however changed after seeing a particular part of the Pokemon Direct:

You take a look at the first Gameboy and talk about how it is a "very large Gameboy" and "something that looks like an arcade machine". Are you kidding me? If that is large then why did you make the 2DS?! It is bigger than the old Gameboy and also way more ugly and that is not just an opinion. Of course the XL versions are pretty large too, but at least you could fold those.

I have not liked any Nintendo hand-held since the DS-Lite so I have not been a big Nintendo fan for the past few years, but with the 2DS and the idiotic Nintendo Direct you have managed a new level of awkwardness. So dear Nintendo, please get a proper product designer and stop with the Nintendo Direct. It is good to be different, but stop being weird.
