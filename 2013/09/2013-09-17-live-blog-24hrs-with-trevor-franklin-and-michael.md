**GTA V is finally here and I have the luxury of not having to work tomorrow. This means that I am going to pull an all-nighter an play GTA V from Tuesday 18:00 until approximately Wednesday 18:00, or until I crash.** **I will keep you posted ever 2-3 hours with a short update about my game-progress/experience and my well-being.Â During these 24 hours you can leave suggestions, comments and questions in the comments below or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/legenddiaries).**
