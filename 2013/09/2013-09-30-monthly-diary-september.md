**September was about two things: Dungeons and Dragons and Grand Theft Auto 5. Â Since I have already talked about both, there is little new to tell in this diary except for my plans for October and a quick recap of September.**

### Expected game activity in October

While September was the month of GTA, October might very well be an extension of that. I did finish the main story but there is still a lot to do in the single-player. On top of that GTA Online will go live on October 1st, which will probably claim most of my free-time in October.

In the first half of September I was busy preparing and playing our first D&D game and since that was a great succes we played another adventure last weekend. Hopefully we can keep this up and play at least one game of D&D in October.

### Legenddiaries in October

Next month I will probably write at least one article about GTA Online, but I have some other posts planned as well. This month I looked at Verdun and I am want to look at another game from the Dutch Game Garden in October.

As you might have noticed I have added a dutch (Nederlands) page to Legenddiaries. I will post the first content in this section in October and (as you might have guessed) in my native language. This is mainly for me to practice writing in Dutch, but also because of the "many" Dutch readers I have.
