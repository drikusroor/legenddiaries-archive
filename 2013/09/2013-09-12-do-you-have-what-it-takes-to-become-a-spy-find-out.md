Have you ever dreamed of becoming a spy after seeing James Bond, becoming a code cracker after reading Dan Brown or just need something to do until Watch\_dogs is released? Then the British intelligence agency GCHQ has posted a very interesting challenge on the internet, with an even more interesting reward. By solving a puzzle in the form of a code on a special hosted website, you can not only win the usual tablets but an actual job at GCHQ. It is not going to be easy though, or better to say: impossible.

As you can see this is not an ordinary cross-word puzzle. Experts say you need a key to the code to decipher it into readable text. If someone succeeds in doing so, he or she has not won yet. From the deciphered code your receive cluesÂ  to go on a cyber treasure-hunt. Those who complete that as well get the opportunity to apply for a job at the agency. GCHQ has set this challenge to look for people who are good at this and can help with future security efforts of the agency.

I think this code is a bit to high-profile for me, so I will wait for Watch\_dogs to crack and hack. Hopefully that will contain awesome (but a bit less impossible) challenges like the one from GCHQ.
