**In the monthly diary of August I talked about dutch game development and promised to show you some dutch games with great potential. I will start with Verdun and I might write about a few more in the next couple of months.** 

##  Verdun

'The First World War' or 'The Great War' was one of the most devastating events Europe has endured in history.In this conflict the way of warfare changed, before WWI armies stood opposed to each other on a big field in plain sight and took a shot at each other. The army that had the most soldiers left standing won the battle and everyone still alive was back at home within a week. This changed in the beginning of the 20th century.

Every Army dug itself in and the first trench-war on European soil was a fact.  This concept of sitting in trenches, and throwing one self over the ramparts to charge the enemy when a whistle blows was a new way of warfare. However, it was not yet the modern tactical warfare of WWII and modern conflicts, which is the setting of many FPS shooters.

This means Verdun is not an ordinary shooter. The maps are quite large but it's very flat but at the same time chaotic because of the trenches. You have to capture certain points before you can advance, but those are really close together which gives you the feeling that you make very little progress. This feeling and the fact that your weapons are really low tech and sometimes inaccurate make this a very strange FPS experience.

Strange but fresh; the different way of warfare from WWI is the thing that makes Verdun worth playing. Running through these trenches and charge an enemy's trench with multiple squads  is worked out well. The graphics are not great but good enough and the detail of weapons is surprisingly good actually. Verdun gets interesting when you play it with 15+ players on each side, because then you really get the feeling you are in a chaotic trench war.

It is not all good though. Like I said the weapons are low tech and sometime inaccurate which adds to the WWI experience, but playing as a machine gunner is nearly impossible and frustrating. Also, the squad system really needs some work because it can take quite long to be able to enter a game because you need one more person in your squad.

Although Verdun has some bad elements it is still in beta. So when you consider the fact that it is in beta and made by an indie dev team that consists of three guys, it shows great potential and is certainly worth watching and playing! Verdun is developed by [M2H](http://www.m2h.nl/) and [Blackmillgames](http://www.blackmillgames.com/) and is currently in open beta which you can download [here](http://beta.verdungame.com/).
