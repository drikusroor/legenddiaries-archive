**August and my summer vacation have come to an end, classes will start on Monday and then it is non-stop learning until July again. Because of this September is not my favorite month. Normally that is, because this year it is the month GTA V comes out. Like most gamers I am psyched, hyped and counting the days until the 17th. September, or a least the second half of it, is going to be awesome and maybe a bit career-ruining. Now I think of it, it's a dick-move of Rockstar to release it 2 weeks after classes start. Anyway, let's have a look at August: the month in which I played a lot of the sims, I did not go to Gamescom, I had an awesome [AOE II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II:_The_Conquerors) LAN-night with my friends and I bought Counterstrike Global Offensive.**

### Laserlaming

In my last monthly diary I wrote that I was going to Gamescom. Well turns out that waiting until the last week to buy tickets, because "why would a game convention be sold-out?", was a bad idea. So me and my friends had to find another activity for that day, to make up for this disappointment. First we thought about just going to Köln and check-out the city. However all the stores were closed on Sunday and there was nothing to do besides Gamescom.

So someone came up with the idea to go play laser tag, which we all thought was a good idea except for one guy. When he heard the word laser-gaming he instantly cried out; "laser-laming!". So we had to talk him through some unresolved childhood issues before we could go. We split up in two teams of four people and 40 dark , intense and sweaty minutes later (there is a good dirty joke there) we were really tired but completely psyched about the whole thing. (and in my teams case victorious). If laser tag was a sport I would consider to start doing sports.

### [This Is the End](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245492/?ref_=sr_1)

I was already looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer. Mainly because apocalypse/end of the world movies are always funny, but also because Seth Rogen and James Franco are pretty epic actors you might know from 'Pineapple Express' and the amazing and short-lived series 'Freaks and Geeks'. It would not have been the first time a promising trailer has misled me, but this is not the case with 'This Is the End'. After seeing it I wanted to see it again immediately. (Which I did)

It's a comedy were every actor plays himself with a lot of self-mockery. There are a lot of tense and freighting moments, but those are quickly dismantled with a lot of humor and genitals. It's also s movie in a movie in a..... something. 'This Is the End' has a lot of mind-fucks, regular fucks and big penises and iff you have not seen it yet, I advise you to do so now.

### Flatout 3

This month I discovered that Flatout 2, my favorite arcade racer, had a sequel from 2011 and was actually developed by a game developer from the Netherlands! Which should be a good thing, but somehow these people managed to take a perfect IP and destroy it completely. Only the steering is not that bad, but that is about it. The graphics are worse than in Flatout 2, the levels are chaotic (in a bad way) and it's  nearly impossible to finish a race. A waste of money and time. I tried think of a game that was also this bad, but I could not come up with a greater or equal disappointment.

To save the reputation of the Dutch people as game developers, I will allow myself to be a bit chauvinistic and point out the fact that we also make Killzone. Also a lot of smaller games show great potential and that is why I plan on writing about a few of these games that are being developed here and hope that people will forget Flatout 3.

### September

The month in which:

- I am going to play GTA V like the rest of the world
- I must really not forget my girlfriends birthday on the 16th even though GTA is release the next day
- I must accept the fact that Rome Total War has to wait a month
- I will play D&D again if all goes well
- I set school as number one priority
- I realize I cannot combine gaming and school and that a master's degree in [procrastination](http://www.legenddiaries.com/other/procrastinationon-a-sunday/) is my only option
