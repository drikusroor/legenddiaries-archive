Once upon a time there were these guys who made some top down view free-roam game where you got to run people over and shoot them in the head. The newspapers were not as enthusiastic as you would think, neither were the big guys in congress. However, it might have been the most free publicity a GTA game ever got. In anyway it was a game that started one of the greatest franchise ever and The Guardian has interview the guys that worked on the first GTA. Definitely worth watching before you go pick up your copy of GTA V.
