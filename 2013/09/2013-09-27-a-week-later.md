**It has been over a week since I put GTA V into my Playstation. I have done not much else  in my free-time since then, so it is fair to say that GTA V got me 'hooked'. I will not write a whole review since there are enough of those on the internet yet, I will however give you a short update about my experience on GTA so far.**

From Tuesday till Saturday I have been focusing on the main story and left most of the strangers and freaks, exploration and collectibles alone. I did some races and went on a couple of road trips but those were only small detours from the main story.  In other GTA games, or sandbox games in general, I focused on finding out how much I could do before actually completing the main story. I think because that way I get to experience the freedom the game has to offer right a way. With GTA V however I constantly had the story in the back of my head, wanting to know what would happen next. The story is funny, tense, strange and all lot of other things you will also find in reviews of Tarantino movies.

After completing the main story I did have some issues with the game. The police overreact, when you look at an officer he will pull his gun out. It is way to difficult to get enough money for the high-end properties, this is definitely out of balance. The Social Club is not working properly which means I still cannot trade on the BAWSAQ or upload nice pictures. These are minor issues though, although the [Social Club can cause problems for GTA Online ass well](http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51422/some-more-details-on-grand-theft-auto-online.html) which is worrying.

Compared to the rest of the game these are small complaints though, GTA V came through on all its promises. I am currently at 20% of my second play through (I stopped at 76% on my first save game). Now that I know the story's ending I can explore and get side tracked without the pressure of needing to know what is going to happen. I also try to be more careful with my money and try to do the heist perfectly so I will actually be able to buy some property at the end of the game.

For the rest of September and probably the whole of October I will not write much, since GTA V and Online will have most of my attention!
