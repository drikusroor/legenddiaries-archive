It is the third blogging week for me and I think it is time for a confession. I have only talked about games that are generally accepted as "cool" up until now, but I must tell you that I also play the Sims. Actually I play The Sims a lot, a real virtual dollhouse pwner, if you will. Building houses, community lots and legacies. Reach the top of the career ladder or make money with your own business. I can't get enough of it and Maxis will not let me, because they release [expansions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_3#Expansion_packs) and [stuff packs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_3#Stuff_packs) almost every other month.

This week another stuff pack was released: [70's 80's and 90's stuff](http://thesims.com/en_US/the-sims-3-70s-80s-90s-stuff). I am not a big fan of those stuff packs, because they are never really worth the money. I was however a little bit excited about this one. I was imagining cool clothes from the seventies, creating hippies and recreate [Woodstock '69](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZfoWcnoNXw). What a fool was I to think this stuff pack might actually be worth the 19,99€.

First the items with which I was going to build grunge clubs and roller disco's. There are 31 (read: 30) new items, which actually does not sound that bad. However since there are three different decades to cover, this makes it an average of 10 items per decade. Not 10,33333, because one of those 31 items is an archway which is pretty much the same as the ones already in the game. There are some cool items like funky chairs, groovy tv sets and a flashy guitar, but nothing that gets my mojo working.

The stuff pack also comes with some clothes. I checked out the female wardrobe first. I count 5 different shirts, 4 types of pants and 12 different outfits. Well that's not bad actually, especially since I see myself using most of them on my lady Sims. However since I play more with males I quickly checked out their updated wardrobe.

2 shirts, 2 pants, 4 outfits and a mustache. That's it. I know that previous stuff packs had a focus on women clothing, but they at least put it in the title. I mean when I see a 'Katy Perry'or 'h&m' stuff pack, I just wait for the next one. No hard feelings. However making me think about making a Jimmy Hendrix, Chris Cornell or Axel Rose Sim and put only 2 shirts, 2 pants and 4 outfits in? I do take that personal! And I feel discriminated as a man! (A man who plays The Sims, but still)

I hope that Maxis hires a few actual men to work on their next stuff pack and stop this inequity. I can now only hope the university expansion will be awesome, which it probably is since the university expansion for The Sims 2 was the best expansion in my opinion. So I say: save those 20€ for [University life](http://thesims.com/en_US/the-sims-3-university-life) or buy the neighborhood [Monte Vista](http://store.thesims3.com/montevista.html?categoryId=12642) with it, because those are worth you precious monies!
