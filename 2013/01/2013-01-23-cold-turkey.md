[Cold Turkey](http://getcoldturkey.com/) is actually not a game, but it is a really nice tool. We all have those moments that we have to get of the internet and be productive in some way. If you can do that outside, like a [lumberjack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zey8567bcg), this tool is of no use to you. However if you work inside and with a computer, keep reading.

When I have to write an essay I do everything to avoid actually writing my essay. First get coffee, go to bathroom, get the mail, decide what's for diner and then read anything on the internet as long it's not homework related. Especially the internet is a real time consumer when you have to do something else. For those people who have little self control, a student has made a nice application.

It's called Cold Turkey and basically does one thing; block websites for a certain amount of time. You can choose the time and websites yourself and when you activate Cold Turkey you are and I quote: "Screwed". Until the time you have selected has passed you cannot access those websites or turn Cold Turkey off. The only thing you can do is block more websites.

So if you have no self control like me you can download Cold Turkey from [this website](http://getcoldturkey.com/download.html). Now I just need a similar application to block games and I might even become productive.
