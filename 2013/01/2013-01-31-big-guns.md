![The Rocketeer](images/The-Rocketeer1.png)In Minecraft you get to build, create, survive and kill zombies, which of course we all love. However there are those moment that you kind of want to see it all blown to pieces, just for the fun of it.  You can do this by putting a load of TNT under it or there are those who turn too [griefing](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Griefing). Well for those with an itch for demolishing Minecraft creations there is a solution!

It's called Aces of Spades and it's basically Minecraft with [Big Guns](http://youtu.be/zNiqnnn39PA). On their [website](http://www.aceofspades.com/) they advertise it with 'construction, combat and creativity'. You can blow levels apart and build them up again and are able to construct anything. Good sales pitch, because me and two other friends bought it immediately of [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/224540) when we had seen the trailer. It might have helped that is was on sale and only 6,50€. (it is 7,99€ at the moment)

It is actually as awesome as shown in the trailer, because the whole level can be destroyed. Destroying an enemy's base is actually the goal in a certain gamemode! You can approach an enemy's flag by digging a tunnel and reinforce your own base with new blocks. You do not get a lot of freedom when building, but it is very useful to get places or block the path of you enemy. The building is however not the element that makes this a good game, it is the digging!

The game has four classes: The Sniper, The Rocketeer, The Miner and The Commando. The Miner is the best digger. He is the one that digs a tunnel, comes up under the enemy's base and destroys it with TNT from underneath. This works great and is not as overpowered as you might think. The miner runs out of TNT quickly and the other three classes outgun his shotgun easily. The Rocketeer is also a lot of fun, because he can plant turrets and fly for short amounts of time! The jetpack thing is very useful, especially when you have to avoid zombies for example.

The zombie mode is awesome. The zombie virus randomly picks one player who then has to spread the virus. Of course every one picks the Rocketeer for this mode to hop from building to building. However there is always that player that won't reach the next building or is not careful enough when picking up ammo. The virus always spreads and the game always ends with a bunch of fast zombies destroying every building and tree in their path to reach the last player. If the last player manages to kill all the zombies, he wins. However this almost never happens

Although I do not get to build as much as I like, this is an awesome game. The digging and destroying brings a new dynamic to familiar shooter modes, which basically means a total mayhem. It will not keep you occupied for days, but the short sessions (preferably played with friends) are totally worth the 8 euros!

If you already have it go check t[heir Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/aceofspadesgame?fref=ts) because they are planning to add new maps, depending on your vote!!
