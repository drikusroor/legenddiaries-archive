With all the rumors about the next generation consoles one might forget there are some pretty awesome games scheduled for release this year. Below my top 5 most anticipated games of 2013. I must warn you that this list is biased and only a reflection of my own refined taste. If you agree or disagree, let me know your most anticipated games for 2013 in the comment section below!

 

## #5 Pokemon X and Y

_To be released in October 2013 for Nintendo 3DS_

I had a bit of a dilemma about including the new Pokemon in the top 5.  It is yet another Pokemon game which will not be that different from it's predecessors, except for the 3D part. However Pokemon is one of the rare game series out there that is still popular after so many years. I myself have played them all up until now. So for me a new Pokemon game is always something to look forward too. The fact that the long cry for a complete 3D world has finally been answered, only adds to that. Also the combination of old and new Pokemon will be present in X and Y, which should be a big plus for any Pokemon fan whom has been playing it from the first generation on.

Another reason for picking Pokemon is that I wanted to include at least one handheld game and there was nothing more exciting that Pokemon X and Y so far. More information on Super Smash Bros for 3DS and Wii-U might change that.

## #4 Rome Total War II

_To be released in October 2013 for Windows_

For me the Rome version of the Total War series was the best by far. Medieval could compete a little bit, but it was just so much more fun to exterminate civilizations in antique times. This is i my opinion the most interesting RTS coming out in 2013 in my opinion. (Although Company of Heroes 2 is also worth [watching](http://youtu.be/BprB15p8Amc))

The little game play of RTW II that has been released up until now shows great improvement and new elements. We will be able to conquer cities over land and water in one battle which brings a whole new dynamic to the game. It looks amazing, which also means it is probably going to be rough on older machines.

Like Pokemon it will not be out until October, but maybe this [Extended Cultures](http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=1101) mod will keep you occupied until then.

## 3# The Elder Scrolls Online

_To be or not to be released in 2013 for Windows and OS X_

The developers of this game do not have an easy job; not only are they creating a game that has live up to be yet another "World of Warcraft killer" it also has to live up to The Elder Scrolls series.  You might have read [my opinion](http://www.legenddiaries.com/opinion/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-a-mmo/) on the latter discussion and noticed I am watching the progress of TESO with great interest.

The Elder Scrolls Online is number three in this list, but only game I am a little bit worried about. MMOs are tricky in general because you play in a world with a lot of others, which is really hard to manage from the developers side. However if done properly it can be awesome and lets not forget addictive.

I will try this game any way, but cannot help wondering if there will be a monthly fee, a free to play model or that you can buy it without returning fee. Free to play will increase the number of friends joining me on epic quests, but that probably means micro-transactions, which I hate. I think I like the Guild Wars model best: buy the game for full price and then just play it without returning fee.

I hope they will be able to release it this year like promised. Oh and don't forget to sign up for that [beta](http://signup.elderscrollsonline.com/)..

## 2# SimCity 5

_To be released on March 5th 2013 for Windows and OS X_ 

Yes SimCity 5 is higher on the list than TESO. This is my list and I will not bend to popular opinion. I have played the beta for the past two days and it was awesome!!

It has been 10 years since SimCity 4 was released and most people had given up any hope on a new City Building game from Maxis. Especially after something called SimCity Societies that had the same name, but was most certainly not worth the name.

SimCity 5 will introduce multi-city play, which means your cities connect with cities of your friends or the rest of the world. There will be a global market, region projects, city specialization and so many other awesome new feature. From the beta I can tell the graphics are not groundbreaking, but when playing SimCity \*Jedi mind trick\* that's not the thing you're looking for..

## 1# Grand Theft Auto V

_To be released in 2013 for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 (Has not been confirmed for Windows)_

Rockstar is doing anything to create a hype around the new GTA, in which they pretty much succeed. Some say it will never be able to live up to the hype created around it, but since I have never been disappointed by a GTA game I doubt that.

We will be able to return too Los Santos, which we visited in GTA San Andreas. Of course the city will be bigger, more detailed etc. And lets not forget those three main characters! These three characters are interesting story-wise, but will also influence the game play. Maybe there will be some sort of coop features. Rockstar did say they had big multiplayer plans.

Although Rockstar has mentioned the game will not include the freedom of buying houses and business like in San Andreas. I definitely hope we will get a little bit more freedom than in GTA IV or at least enough stuff we can spend our precious heisted money on!
