[Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0) is a website where you can learn HTML, CSS, PHP and many more coding languages. This stuff seems all very complicated and I for one was not very eager to learn any more HTML or CSS and definitely not something even more complicated. However, a friend of mine was so enthusiastic I decided to try it.

So I made a profile and started my first HTML lesson in which I learned that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language  and how to make text super fancy. Pretty impressive right..

After a couple of hours you will be finished with HTML and CSS and you move on too Java, which is also taught in comprehensible exercises. It is easy and doable for everybody who knows how a keyboard works.

The cool thing about Code Academy is that your progress is visible on your profile.  As you finish exercises and courses you earn badges which are like achievements in games.  After completing a certain number of exercises, finishing a courses, finishing your first lesson and so on; you get a badge! This makes it a bit addictive like games.  Your achievements are shown on a personal [profile](http://www.codecademy.com/users/zomers) so you can compare your progress with that of your friends or use is as a part of your resume.

There are multiple success stories on the website about people who found a job or made a career switch with the knowledge they got. I have doubts about how this will be the case for people on a large scale in the near future, but it is definitely more useful than playing Farmville or Bejeweled when you are bored.
