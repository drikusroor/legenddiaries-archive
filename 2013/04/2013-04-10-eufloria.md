Since I have a tablet I have been looking for a game that is similar to Civilization. Civilization would be a perfect game to play on your tablet in my opinion because, you can play it on a touchscreen without any surrogate (most likely frustrating) on-screen control pads like with shooters or race games. This is sadly not available except for a freeware version: [Freeciv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.org.zielinscy.freeciv&hl=nl), an Android game which is free as the name suggests and is similar to Civilization III. However Freeciv is not that much fun and by now you might be wondering why I am rambling about Civilization when the title says Eufloria.

Well I had to continue my search for a game that was like Civilization, suitable for touchscreens and relaxed to play. On this search I found [Eufloria](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omnilabs.eufloria.demo&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5vbW5pbGFicy5ldWZsb3JpYS5kZW1vIl0.), which is nothing like Civilization which might make the introduction of this post seem somewhat redundant.  However, when I found Eufloria, I found maybe the first game on android which is genuinely amazing. Of course [Angry Birds](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirds&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5yb3Zpby5hbmdyeWJpcmRzIl0.) is 'fun' and I spent a lot of hours with [Game Dev Story](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kairosoft.android.gamedev3en&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5rYWlyb3NvZnQuYW5kcm9pZC5nYW1lZGV2M2VuIl0.), but Eufloria is different. Eufloria Feels like a game that was made for mobile gaming with a touchscreen, which is ironic since it has actually been developed and released for PC and Playstation first.

When you steer your seedlings around and colonize and explore it all feels very natural, which is kind of the whole setting of the game. The music and pretty cool graphics make it all the better. It is a very intuitive RTS which can be played fanatically on a high difficulty, but also relaxed while watching TV or something. The story is kind of limited and shallow, but that is luckily not what this game is for.

At this point I should probably tell you more about gameplay and what the game is actually like, but I will not do that. Instead I ask you to trust me on this one and just get it from the [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omnilabs.eufloria.demo&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5vbW5pbGFicy5ldWZsb3JpYS5kZW1vIl0.) if you like what you see in the trailer. I promise it will keep you occupied for many hours and you will not regret it.

One last thing: the game has settings which you should check out before you start because after playing for 2 hours I discovered you can increase the graphic details and make the very large UI a lot smaller! Which makes all the difference.
