**When you say Pokémon most people will think of Pikachu. This yellow mouse-like pocket monster is the icon of all that is Pokémon; even your mom will know it by name. Nintendo has cleverly used and promoted the popularity of Pikachu and even put it on a [diet](http://www.digdang.com/image/pikachus_diet_worked/7705/). There is however another icon that is more present and in my opinion iconic for the Pokémon franchise: the Pokéball.**

The Pokéball is a mechanism that retains Pokémon in form of energy, so Pokémon trainers do not have to walk them around like dogs. Which is very important because otherwise the streets of the Pokémon world would be flooded with all kinds of monsters. If you think I exaggerate: imagine that everyone in your neighborhood has six dogs and that some of those dogs are the size of a [whale](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Wailord_(Pok%C3%A9mon)).

Inspiration for this nifty invention comes from something called ['Gashapon'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon) ,which are capsuled toys that can be bought at vending machines. The Pokéballs in the manga resemble these Gashapon the most, because these balls are see-through. The Pokémon can be seen inside, just like the toys from the Gashapon. Later in the anime and games the top-half of the Pokéball is colored solid red and it becomes a bit of a mystery how Pokémon trainers know which ball contains which Pokémon.

The Pokéballs in the games and anime are produced by [Sliph Co.](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Silph_Co.) and [Devon Corporation](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Devon_Corporation). Before these companies developed and mass-produced Pokéballs, Pokémon were caught in apricorns fitted with a special mechanism.  Kurt from Azeala town still knows how to craft these and will do so if the player brings him apricorns.

While there is only one type of Pikachu, the yellow kind, there are 26 different types of Pokéballs. Most people will know the standard Pokéball that is red and white. This is the Pokéball Ash uses most of the time in the anime and the ball that is first available to you in the games. It is also on the back of Pokémon cards and is the ball that is so iconic for the franchise. The other 25 balls all have their specific look and uses, depending on the kind Pokémon or situation.

The Great Ball and the Ultra Ball are almost the same as the Pokéball except that they have a higher catch rate. In the beginning of the games you will use the standard Pokéballs, but when the Pokémon you meet become stronger you will have to switch to the Great Ball and later on the Ultra Ball. However, catching a Legendary Pokémon with Ultra Balls may still require a lot of them. You could use the Master Ball in this case because it has a catch rate of 99,999%, but you only get one of those.

I am sure they are all very useful and some you even have to use, like the Safari Ball. But I find balls like the Dusk Ball or the Net Ball a bit redundant since I can catch those Pokémon with a normal Pokéball as well. My favorite Pokéball is the Premier Ball, because it's free and sounds very premium. When you buy 10 Pokéballs at once you receive a Premier Ball for free, which is just good costumer service. De ball itself is not actually better, since it is exactly the same as the standard Pokéball, but it looks pretty fancy.

I have grown attached to the Pokéball and to my Pokémon that it retained over the years and still smile whenever I see one of these red and white colored balls somewhere. Maybe even more than when I see Pikachu.

Since the variety of Pokéballs has clearly outgrown me, I wonder if I am the only one who just uses normal Pokéballs, Premier Balls, Ultra Balls (when I have to) and the Master Ball (to catch those legendary Pokémon that are running around). Let me know which balls you favor.
