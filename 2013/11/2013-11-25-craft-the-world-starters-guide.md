**Even though Craft the World's early access release is still a bit rough on the sides, it is  already a very addictive game. However, without extensive online guides or wikis it is very difficult to get started. So that is why I have made a short beginners guide to keep your dwarfs happy and alive.**

### Portals

You might think this is to obvious to talk about in a Craft the World starters guide, but it took me about an hour and half to discover how useful portals are. You can find the Portal spell in crafting and just place it on the toolbar on the bottom of the screen, because you are going to use it a lot. Whenever your dwarfs are working far away from your base or stockpile, place a portal near the place of business and gathering, building and moving around the map will go much faster. You can not use them as much as you want though, so watch your mana.

### Go underground

The logical thing to do is build the shelter for your dwarfs around the stockpile, to protect it. Do not do this. It costs a lot of wood and time to build a shelter above the ground that is big enough. If you try to do this your dwarfs will be cranky, hungry and maybe even dead by the time you gathered enough wood and finished building. Leave your stockpile alone and just build a shelter underground first. Close it of with a hatch and you're safe for the first few goblin attacks. They will steal some resources, but it will keep your dwarfs alive and well rested.

#### A good night sleep does wonders

Your dwarfs will get tired and wounded after a while and will be asking for a bed. Make sure you have beds available as soon as possible, since it will allow them to rest and regain health. Remember to place a bed for every single dwarf because no matter how tired they get, they will not sleep in someone else's bed.

### I has hungry!

If you think the dwarfs like nothing more but sleep, your wrong. Food is what they want the most and need the most. There will drop some apples when you chop down a tree, but this is not enough. Look around for some berry bushes and make sure to pick those so your dwarfs have food for the first few nights.

### Take control

If you select a dwarf you can take control of him and directly control his moves and actions. This comes in handy when they wander in the direction of a goblin camp, but even more when building larger structures. Dwarfs on the auto-pilot can only reach one square above them, dwarfs in control by you can reach two squares above them. On top of that, if you click to build something like a wall, it will be placed instantly. This saves the time of running back and forth between the building site and stockpile.

### Do not mourn the dead

Life ain't easy and dwarfs might die. Do not start over every time you lose one of them. With all the enemies around there is a high chance a dwarf gets killed in the beginning, so it is difficult to prevent an occasional death. Also, a dead dwarf is replaced after 5 minutes which means it is only a loss for a short period of time.  Remember to pick up the fallen dwarfs items once the coast is clear.

### Complete tasks

Try to focus on completing tasks and advancing through the tech tree from the beginning. This will help you get useful tools like weapons, pickaxes, doors, walls and other essential stuff. These are the key to fighting off enemies and setting up a base. When you have basic weapons, shelter, food and fortifications, you can think about exploring or attacking a goblin camp.

### Craft fortifications

The occasional goblin or skeleton is not that much of a threat but the monster waves that come roughly every 45 minutes, are. In preparation for these you need to build trenches and a wall. While the monsters can smash through the wall they will need to stand next to it in order to hit it. Therefore if you build a wall right next to a trench they will need to stand on top of each other to reach it. This will thin the horde or, when your trench is deep enough, they might not hit your wall at all.
