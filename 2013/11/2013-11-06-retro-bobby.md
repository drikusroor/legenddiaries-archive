I myself hate getting a haircut. Mainly because you have to pay a strange person for making small talk , while hovering around you with scizors. That this is a reoccurring thing every 2 months or so, does not help. A hair salon which is actually a game store and where you can play games while getting a haircut, is therefore something I could only dream about. So did Bobby (although I suspect him to be more favorable towards hair dressers since he is one) and he actually started a store like that which [Copenhagers](http://vimeo.com/copenhagers) filmed. Enjoy.
