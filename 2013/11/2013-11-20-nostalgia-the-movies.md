**I often think about games I played more than 5 years ago and most of them are amazing in my memory. I always tell myself that they are probably not that amazing and playing them again will ruin my good (and very nostalgic) memories of them. I keep wondering though: what if they are in fact that good? What if I am missing out on some great gameplay just because I am afraid I will be disappointed. So I decided I must overcome this fear and just play these games again. This time I look at The Movies.**

The Movies was developed by the (in)famous Peter Molyneux when he was still working for Lionhead Studios. Inspiration for the game came from an older movie studio sim: Hollywood Mogul. In this game from 1997 you had to manage a movie studio including it's stars, production and movie releases. The Movies which launched in 2005 draws a lot from Hollywood Mogul and was very well received ([84 on metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-movies)). The fact that it got such high scores is not because it's just a good management game, it goes beyond that.

In The Movies you actually create movies. Within this studio you have to manage you can write your own scripts. You can choose the characters, the stages, the scenes, the amount of scenes, the props and I probably forgot some features that you can use when creating a script. After the script is done you can choose the actors and directors from your studio and they will start shooting. You can see all the scenes that you created being shot on set and when that is done you can edit the film and release it. At first you will not have many technologies, sets and costumes available, but as time progress and you move through the 30's 40's 50's etc. you get more options and you can make more interesting movies.

I remembered the movie making as the most important aspect of the game when I played it back in 2005.  However,when I played it again last week I found myself focusing more on the managing aspect and making money, rather than making movies. The movie making does take a lot of time and especially in the beginning of the game the options are not that extensive. While this sounds like a negative point, it is not. The great thing is that this game can be played in several ways and it will be great no matter how you play. If you just want to focus on making the movie studio look great, you can do that. If the management part is not interesting to you, just play on easy and make great movies. If you do not like creating movies just hire script writers to make movies for you, so you can focus on preventing stars throwing tantrums. These possibilities give you a great feeling of freedom when playing the Movies.

**Verdict**

My experience with The Movies in 2005 was very different from my recent play sessions. I focused more on managing and making money, than making movies. This shows how unique The Movies is. You can be creative and make awesome movies with this game, but it can also be played as any other economic sim, like Zoo Tycoon, Tycoon Rollercoaster or Hollywood Mogul, in which The Movies excels as well.
