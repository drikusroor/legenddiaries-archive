**[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/hello?ref=nav) is one of the most popular crowd-funding websites out there. For those few who might have missed this awesome concept of funding; a project gets funded by backers who believe in it and if a project has enough backers the project will become reality.  Through Kickstarter many projects have been funded: art projects, movies , music, theater, gadgets and most important of all: games! If I come across something interesting I will post it here and first up is: [Comic ConQuest](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1314540505/comic-conquest-a-party-based-tactical-rpg), which still needs 7.748$ with only 13 days left at the moment of writing.**

**Genre:** Party-based Tactical RPG **Developer:** [Sleepy Giant](http://www.sleepygiant.com/) **Platform:** PC, Mac, Android, Ios

I must admit my knowledge of comics does not go far beyond the Batman movies, Iron Man and The Avengers. I also have never been to Comic Con since it takes place on the other side of the Atlantic ocean. So why my interest in this game?  I am not sure why, but the comic-look and the description "a Comic Con gone wrong"  are just very appealing. Put those aspects in a Party-based Tactical RPG and you have something potentially awesome.

The emphasis in the promotion of their game lies on the graphics for which they attracted the great comic-artist Jeff Matsuda (and by 'the' I mean that I even know his name..). He has worked on Batman, The Avengers, X-men and many other comics. With him on the team, Comic ConQuest must guarantee that the heroes look "so original and not copyright infringing you'll feel like you grew up with these heroes". As for gameplay they are going for a fast paced but turned based combat system, mixed with trivia challenges and character customization. From this description I expect something like the combat system in Fire Emblem. Comic ConQuest will also have a cooperative mode, so you can play with friends. (As I reread this paragraph I realized it is a lot like D&D but then again, which game isn't)

I expect that this game will offer us a great adventure full of references to games, comics and movies. Loaded with humor and potentially great graphics. Add the party-based tactical RPG gameplay and extensive  customization options to that and you have an impressive list of features in this game. I would like to see some in-game footage as most backers would, but it looks like it has to reach is 20.000$ goal before that is going to happened.  Hopefully it does and maybe even with your help. You get (early) game access for 10$ or more.
