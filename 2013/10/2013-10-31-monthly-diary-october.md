**A lot of rain came down here in the Netherlands during October and we even had to endure the first Autumn storm which was the greatest storm we have had since 1990. Most people do not favor rain but it gives one the opportunity to stay inside for long periods of (game) time without feeling guilty. October was therefore a very "productive" month for me.**

### Pokémon Champion and GTA Online

The Pokémon hype was big this month and it might have subconsciously caused me to become Pokémon Champion in the Jotho League. I have played the games with the first generation Pokémon multiple times and also Ruby, Diamond and Black at least once past the elite four. The second generation in Silver, Gold and Crystal I somehow skipped. So this summer I started my journey through Jotho and after 60 hours defeated the Pokémon Champion Lance. It was only then I discovered \[minor spoiler\] that you get to explore the Kanto an Hoenn region as well, in both SoulSilver and HeartGold! So my journey continues and Pokémon X and Y have to wait a couple of months.

The second reason for playing Pokémon was the troublesome launch of GTA Online. October should have been the month of GTA Online but I have only been able to play for the last two weeks of October. The time I did play was awesome and although there is still a lot to fix and improve for Rockstar I suspect that I will be playing this for a long time to come. The launch problems will soon be forgotten and at least it gave me the time to become Pokémon Champion, which looks way better on my resumé that 'experienced digital bankrobber'.

### Plans for November

Because I did not come through on my plans in previous monthly diaries and the amount of studying I have to do, I will not make any plans and you will just have to wait and see what turns up on your favorite blog in November. Exciting isn't it?
