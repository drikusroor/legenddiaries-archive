[IGN](http://www.ign.com/) has taken it upon themselves to decide once and for all which is the best Pokémon. They have made a [face-off voting system](http://www.ign.com/face-off/pokemon) in which two Pokémon at the time are presented to you. You have to vote for the better one of the two and you can do this as many times as you want. There are some though choices (Dragonite and Articuno) but also very easy ones (Sawk or Trubbish). The system might be a bit time-consuming and strange since you are dependent on which Pokémon are presented through the website. It would definitely have been easier to just let everyone call their favorite Pokémon and be done with it.

If I would have something better to do with my time I might not have even voted. At least it is a good way to catch up on your Pokémon knowledge! So there are definitely (a few) worse ways to get through your Sunday. IGN anounces the absolute best Pokémon on November 1st.
