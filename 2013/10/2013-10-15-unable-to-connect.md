**It has been 2 weeks since GTA Online went live. Unfortunately most people are unable to connect to the Rockstar servers up until now and if you get through you experience lots of bugs and lag. This means GTA Online can be added to the list of bad online game launches. This list gets longer every year and I am wondering why it is still so difficult for publishers and developers to have a smooth online launch with their games.**

The causes of these server problems at launch are bugs and insufficient server capacity, often the latter. In the case of SimCity which launched earlier this year it was a combination of both. It had a lot of bugs but also way more players than expected. It took them weeks to fix this and make SimCity playable for everyone who bought the game. They managed to do this by adding more servers and temporarily [disabling non-essential features.](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/0/9341242.page)  This directly effected their sales. Unlike GTA there was no offline singleplayer and players had to wait for a fix to play the game at all. Of course one cannot know how sales would have been with a successful launch, especially since insufficient server capacity was not the only thing wrong with SimCity, but I think it is safe to assume sales would have been better.

Not only Rockstar and Maxis have had these problems, another big game developer you are probably familiar with has a history of troublesome online game launches. When Blizzard released their revolutionary MMO World of Warcraft the launch was anything but smooth. Their expectations of the amount of players buying their game on release were greatly underestimated which resulted in queues of thousands and latency problems for those who managed to get into the servers. With the release of The Burning Crusade they were surprised yet again by ex-players who returned for the new content. The launch of the other three expansions went a lot better but a couple of months before the release of SimCity they failed again with the launch of Diablo 3.

The releases of SimCity and Diablo 3 got more attention because of the crusade on [DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), but with all incidents I mentioned before it was bad press which most likely effected sales in a bad way. This raises the question why game developers and publishers cannot prevent these issues, since it does a lot of damage to their name and product. Is it that hard to anticipate the amount of players at launch or are they being cheap and trying to save on server-costs as much as possible?

In the case of the 0f the MMOs there is an explanation other than money for keeping the amount of servers at the minimum amount needed. World of Warcraft consists of different realms (servers) in which players create a character. At a certain moment the amount of players decreases and some of these realms become very low populated which affects the game experience. It is a lot of hassle for Blizzard to merge realms or migrate a large amount of players because these realms all have their own economy, guilds and balance. So when they create to many servers at launch this causes problems later. With newer MMOs like The Elder Scrolls Online this should no longer be a (legitimate) excuse because they now have the technology to create [mega servers](http://www.tesoelite.com/2013/04/elder-scrolls-online-mega-server-explained/).

As for other online games which do not have characters bound to servers or realms the cause of these troublesome launches is bad preparation or trying to save money on servers (or both). I can understand that it is hard to anticipate the amount of players at launch, but they should prepare for the worst. When they installed more servers than needed they can always decrease the amount of servers later on. Also, running more extended beta test can be a solution to this problems. SimCity had a beta test only a few weeks before the initial release which presented them with a lot of problems, which they clearly were not able to fix in such a short time-span.

Although I can understand that it is a great challenge to have a normal online launch when your game sells [15 million copies](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/430798/gta-5-sales-top-15-million-units-analyst-suggests/) in the first week, it is at least a bit odd that so many games have so many problems when it comes to online launches. The developers and publishers I mentioned, Rockstar, Blizzard and Maxis, are not newcomers to the business either.They are at the top of the game industry food chain.

I do not agree with those making war on DRM or bashing these games for a poor online launch, because these companies do not do this on purpose. However, I do believe that with better preparation like beta testing or adjusting your server capacity for the worst case scenario, these launches could have gone a lot better. It could be that I am greatly underestimating this problem and that we are a long way from smooth online launches, but I really hope upcoming launches like that of The Elder Scrolls online will go a lot better and is not followed by another hate-storm on the internet.
