#### The Kickstarter funding deadline of [Comic ConQuest](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1314540505/comic-conquest-a-party-based-tactical-rpg) was yesterday and they have received $22.699 from backers which means they have surpassed the initial funding goal! So it is time to look at another project that needs funding. Well 'need' is not really an accurate description since [RimWorld](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tynansylvester/rimworld) already  received over $160.000(CAD) from backers which is a far more than the goal of $20.000.  This means that this Kickstarter campaign is already successful and hopefully the game will be too and if not, it will not be because of lack of funds.

**Genre:** Sci-fi Colony Sim **Developer:** [Tynan Sylvester](tynansylvester.com) **Platform:** Pc,Mac, Linux

Rimworld is about a remote colony of people who have to survive in an inhospitable environment. You are in charge of this colony and have to manage it's resources, buildings and colonists; no extraordinary elements for a sim game. What Tynan Sylvester wants to achieve with this seemingly normal simgame is to let you as player experience interesting stories: "It's not about winning and losing - it's about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.". This should be accomplished by the intelligent AI Storyteller_._ This AI director will throw stuff like bandits, lighting storms, new colonist and psychotic squirrels  at you, depending on the current situation in your colony.

Tynan Sylvester, who has worked on several mods and games (including Bioshock Infinite) before he started this project, needs Kickstarter funds to provide him with people who have the skills to do what he cannot. You might have noticed that the game currently looks a lot like [Prison Architect](http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/). Tynan would like to change this and give RimWorld it's own unique look but he needs someone to do this for him. The same goes for sound.

Even though this project is already funded it is still worth backing. First of all, because with the great amount of funds Tynan received he will be able to put a lot more into the game than he planned, which means more awesomeness. Second of all, you should definitely go for early access on this game which is $20. If you have a bit more money to spare you should consider the $30 pledge since it will come with the prototype games pre-RimWorld (check the video for those prototypes). RimWorld will be officially funded in 8 days.
