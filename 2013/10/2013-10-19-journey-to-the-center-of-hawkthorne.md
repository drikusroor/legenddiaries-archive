**If you have seen the series Community and are past the 2oth episode of the third season you do not have to worry about this minor \[SPOILER ALERT\]. Instead scroll down and be amazed by an impressive fan-project.**

In the 20th episode of the 3rd season Pierce is confronted with the testament of his deceased father. If Pierce wants to receive his inheritance, he has to beat is half-brother in a video-game their father Cornelius created. While Pierce has the study-group to help him, his half-brother Gilbert has way more experience playing the game and so a 16-bit battle unfolds.

If you have seen the episode ["Digital Estate Planning"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Estate_Planning)Â  and consider yourself a 'gamer' you must have thought during this episode: "oh it would be awesome if this game would actually exist". Well a group of people [on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne) had the same thought and created a community that has been working on ['Journey to the center of Hawkthorne'](http://projecthawkthorne.com/index.html) for more than a year. The good news is: it is completely free since it is a fan-project. The bad news: you cannot marry Hilda.

The game is surprisingly accurate. You start with choosing one of the community characters and a costume. I picked Troy and spawned into a very familiar study-room, all alone. Even-though the absence of a multiplayer is understandable, I immediately missed the other characters. Troy would have to face the crawling hippies on his own. Unlike the study group I managed to kill the hippies and got through the Greendale level in one try. Next-up was the floating head of Cornelius which talked (in text) about how Pierce asked him for his game and that he would have to beat it if he wants his inheritance.

Getting this inheritance is not easy because like in the series the game is very unforgiving. When you die you spawn back at the study-room and have to jump on hippies again. With all the waterfalls, jumping fishes and what I assume are running and burning trash-cans this happened more often that I cared for. That is until I found out you can save at the Cornelius statues, which made the game a lot more doable. You also get to keep the coins that are dropped by killed enemies with which you can buy better weapons from the smith in town.

Besides the statues there are other differences with the game in the series but all very minor or understandable. The fact that you cannot marry Hilda and make an army of mini Abeds is not surprising. Also the game is not done yet. There are still levels missing and the end-boss (Cornelius) is not available. The current version of the game is still very impressive and guaranteed fun if you have seen this episode of Community.
