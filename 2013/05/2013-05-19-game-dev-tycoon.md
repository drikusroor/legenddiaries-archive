[![logo-wide-180](images/logo-wide-180.png)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/logo-wide-180.png)I came upon Game Dev Tycoon game through an article about some studio who used torrent sites as a marketing tool. The makers of the game had put an altered version of their game on some torrent sites, moments after their game was released. As the title of the game suggests you have to manage a game develop company and make games. In the torrent version it seems like it is the full game until all of a sudden your games won't make any money with the following explanation:

 "Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally. If players don’t buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt."

Gamers who downloaded this version and were going bankrupt because of piracy were actually asking if there was an option to research DRM, one has to see the irony in that.

The story got picked up on Reddit and soon after that on other websites which generated a lot of free publicity for Game Dev Tycoon. It is the first game by Greenheart Games and since they did not have any money for marketing, the free publicity around their torrent was very welcome.

Patrick, who is one of the creators of this game, wrote about their pirate version of their game on the blog of Greenheart Games which you can read [here](http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/29/what-happens-when-pirates-play-a-game-development-simulator-and-then-go-bankrupt-because-of-piracy/).

### **Bankrupt**

Clever marketing does not make a game good and since it was the first game by this studio I was sceptic and decided to try the demo before buying it. In the demo you get to play the first 5 years of the 30 years that are in the full version of the game. Around the fifth year I had emerged as a game dev from my garage into an office, with some employees and the name on the building. It was awesome.

So I bought the full game and continued making very profitable games. I invested in better staff and marketing to climb the game dev ladder. I had a good feeling about Legendary Games, until the tenth year when all of a sudden my profit dropped. Out of nowhere my games got bad reviews and it didn't take long before I went bankrupt. It was not because of piracy but because I had done something wrong, turns out this is not an easy tycoon game. It could be that I am just not that good, but it was with my 4th studio that I managed to get past the release of the first Playstation and eventually completed the game. Which is not a bad thing, because when you finally get it right you feel like you really earned it.

### The glorious history of gaming

It is awesome that you play through the last 30 years of game history (thanks to a certain  DeLorean) with all its successful and unsuccessful consoles. Of course Greenheart Games could not use the real names of the consoles en publishers, but making a game for a publisher named "Electronic mass productions" or for a console named "The Wuu"  is much funnier anyway.

I feel that they did miss a chance with the history aspect of the game though. You play through the years but the game does not give you a clear indication of what year it is, I think it would have been nice to actually show the year you are in and that you can see that it corresponds with the dates of console releases. However this is a minor thing and they did manage to make it a more historic journey than Game Dev Story.

### Game Dev Story

One can't help to see the similarity with the Game Dev Story game from Kairosoft. However, in my opinion it is definitely not a rip-off. The game from Greenheart Games is a _Tycoon_ game. It is more complicated, better balanced and has a more options. It succeeds in simulating an actual game dev business which is not the case in Game Dev Story. Especially at the end of the game your studio gets pretty big and you have to manage a lot of things.

### Verdict

Game Dev Tycoon kept me up past midnight for at least a week when it came out and which has not happened since Skyrim came out. It has great little visual details, like staff that scratch their head when they are stuck or pieces of paper that blow in the breeze of the air conditioning. The sounds are discreet but very good, especially the little pops you hear whenever one of you staff accumulates points for a game. It will make you feel your employees are working really hard. It is also a challenging game, because I had to start over a couple of times to not go bankrupt after 4 years. The replay-ability might not be that high unless you’re a high-score junky. However, since mod support just went live in a beta version replay-ability might greatly improve. For the current price of 8,99€ this game is definitely worth your money.
