As you might have [read](http://www.legenddiaries.com/opinion/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-a-mmo/) I am following the progress of TESO online with great anticipation and many other people with me. A lot of people are also skeptic and do not think an MMO will fit The Elder Scrolls series, but I think we just have to wait and see. [CVG](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/) posted some new gameplay footage yesterday with combat and lots of scenery and I think it looks very good. After seeing this footage I begin to think Zenimax might have pulled it off and not only created a great MMO but a game that is worthy of The Elder Scrolls title.
