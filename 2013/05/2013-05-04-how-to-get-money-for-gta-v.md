Since we are still in an economic crisis and we are not all Rockefellers, that is a lot of money. Of course you can ask for more allowance or a raise at work, that is if we would live in a Disney movie. That leaves us with waiting for a discount or Christmas, but waiting is not really an option with GTA V. So I present to you: 5 ways how to get money for GTA V before it is released.

## #5 Preform a Heist

This one definitely belongs in the "do not try this at home" list, but is good practice for the many heists in GTA V. You might need a couple of friends though and maybe some sort of plan. If you succeed you can buy GTA V for sure and probably for all your homies as well. Or keep it all and save it for GTA VI and the next-gen consoles. There is a big downside to this plan though; you might get caught. The chances are like 50-50 (either you get caught or you won't) but it's probably better to wait for Christmas.

- Money: $$$$$
- Time: 1-2 weeks (if you include proper planning)
- Pro's: Most profitable in short time and you get to be on tv
- Con's: You might probably end up in jail

## #4 Get a job in IT

In the current economy the only growing business is internet and all the other computer stuff. With all those online self-study tutorials you can learn to be a coder and make cool stuff for a lot of money. Like I wrote in my [article](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/code-academy/) about Code Academy: anyone can do this if you know how a keyboard works. It is also good for your career perspective and your family and friends will definitely be impressed. Some of them might even be a bit scared because they think that if you can build a website, you can hack their computers. Four month's might be a bit short to learn to code and get a job in IT, but if you uncle needs a website, that might be doable.

- Money: $$$
- Time: 1 year (but probably more)
- Pro's: It's legal, it pays well, it's useful for the rest of your life
- Con's: Takes more than four months, you have to get a job

##  #3 Create a viral video

This is maybe something for the more creative people. There is good money in Youtube-ads and people who run a successful Youtube-channel make a decent amount of money off it.  Four months is probably not enough to create a whole channel with subscribers and all that, but it only takes one viral video to get enough money for GTA V. So grab your little brother or the neighbor's cat and let it do something funny, dangerous or the Harlem Shake and just sit back and let the money come to you.

- Money: $$
- Time: 1 hour tops (if your upload is slow maybe 1,5)
- Pro's: Little effort, easy money
- Con's: You have to be creative

## #2 Dumpster dive

Groceries cost a lot of money and people throw away a lot of stuff; these two facts can get you GTA V. Next time you do groceries do not go through the entrance of a supermarket but around the back and check the supermarket's dumpster. You will probably find loads of edible food in there which means you don't have to buy it. It will not make you any money but will save you a lot. You might get a bit dirty, but you should shower everyday anyways with all the bacteria, viruses and monkeys everywhere these days.

- Money: $$
- Time: None,you have to do groceries anyway
- Pro's: It will be a surprise what you get to eat every night
- Con's: People might find it weird that you go into dumpsters

## #1 Online surveys

This one requires no skill and little effort. You just fill in a couple of surveys about what you eat or like on tv and they pay you for it. Doesn't even matter if you answer them in truth, just fill-in the damn thing! It also takes little time and if you just cut back on Facebook and 9gag you will have those 60 bucks in no time.  I have done 15 so far and it only took me 6 hours, but while I was at work so I could not do anything interesting anyway. This is the easiest, safest and best way to get the money for GTA V before it's release date, hell maybe you can even pe-order it a week in advance!

- Money: $
- Time: 4 hours a week
- Pro's: It is easy and requires no skill
- Con's: There are none
