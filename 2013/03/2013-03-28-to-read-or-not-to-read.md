# Game of Thrones

 

On the 1st of April I will be able to see the next episode of Game of Thrones here in Europe. This is maybe one of my most anticipated series that will be continued this year. Not only because it seems to be an epic new season or to see more of [Peter Dinklage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage) as Tyrion Lannister, but mainly to see what will happen in the story.

George R.R. Martin has created an amazing fantasy world which has a very complicated, but intriguing story. The story was actually so extensive and complicated that in the series it has been adapted and characters have been left out, merged or altered. Or that is what I have been told, because I have not actually read the books.

People have told me the books are amazing and, that like Lord of the Rings, you are not a real fan if you have not read the books.  Well I do not really care about being a "real" fan. However, I am tempted to read _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series simply because I want to know what happens next. The series are going fast enough, but there is just to much time between the seasons releases.

Since I like the series so much I could accept the slow release pace and just let them tell the story. I found myself still wanting to read the books though, so I thought I should only read the first two books so the story of the third season would not be spoiled. However, I know that if the books are half as much fun as the series I will read _A Storm of Swords_ anyway.

With movies, or in this case series, based on books it is always a dilemma read the books as well or vice versa. (Except for Harry Potter, but that was because I was about 10 years old and did not know what a dilemma was). But do I dare to take the risk of ruining the series by reading the books or not enjoying the books because of the series? I think not, and just wait for season three because I know for sure that I will enjoy that.

_Edit: on second thought I think I will just read the first book, it's all part of the game right?_
