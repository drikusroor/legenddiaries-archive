Starting as a new and inexperienced pilot in EVE Online is a game experience on itself and definitely not one for [quitters](http://youtu.be/At5xHpybXmE?t=1m). I thought I should give it a try and here is my experience of my first week in EVE Online.

At the beginning of 2013 game news websites reported a huge battle that had taken place in EVE Online, more than 2000 players participated. The battle itself [looks like](http://youtu.be/_iQw3YcLoQU) a bunch of blobs, colored beams and weird space effects, not something that makes me want to start playing EVE. The concept of so many players clashing in a huge battle was very interesting though, so I checked what EVE actually was. After several videos about scams, thievery and [motivational videos](http://youtu.be/pWoOhCYbHKI) I was a little bit more interested, so last week I made a trial account.

The beginning is overwhelming, all things I know from other games and MMO's are worthless here. You don't level up for example, but train skills. This is not done by killing mobs, but just waiting until the training queue is finished. The user interface is very extensive and I was lost instantly. The fact that normal things have some fancy names, like for example a side bar is called the '[Neocom](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Neocom_panel)' , do not make it any easier. The in-game tutorials in EVE are essential to your progress to understand the game, in some games you can skip it, do not even think about that in EVE. However, if you have done them you will only know a tip of the iceberg.

When you check your star-gate jumps on the map, you will see that you will probably never see the whole universe. Also the different career possibilities are huge, I started with mining with which I made some quick profit. When I looked in the [Evelopedia](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Main_Page) for other careers I was immediately intrigued by planetary colonization. You can build colonies which will gather resources for you which you as pilot can sell on the market. Sadly I was not even close to the starting capital you would need to start the most basic colony.

All the possibilities and vast space are not why I liked my first week as an EVE pilot so much, it was the relaxed feeling. It has been a very long time since I came to such a high level of relaxation while playing a game.  Flying, warping and jumping through the beautiful looking space makes me feel at ease. It was almost like I was a little bit high.

I have only a few days left of my trial account and I want to play more although not next week because then I will only have time for Simcity 5, but I would not be suprised if I would return to Eden somewhere in the near future.
