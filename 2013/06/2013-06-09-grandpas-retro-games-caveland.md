#### I like to start June with another game which is probably far greater in my mind than it actually is. The previous nostalgia game I wrote about was [Scarface,](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/grandpas-golden-oldies-scarface/) which was indeed as fun as I remembered it. This time I like to go further back and look at a game from 1996. The only game I played before that is Freddy Fish and everyone knows that Freddy does not need another look  to know that it is awesome. So next up: Caveland.

#### Prologue

I was about 7 or 8 when I played this game and remember that it was all about dwarfs who live underground. You had to build some underground village, gather all kind of resources and there was also something with puzzles, but I believe those were to difficult for me at the time. Besides being to young to be able to solve the puzzles and finishing the game, I also missed a lot of jokes. From the Prologue I never got that this game is actually about a bunch of beer drinking dwarfs who are hungover most of the time and that the beer is the cause of all the trouble they are in.

So you, the player who comes not even close to their expectations, is the one who has to restore the mystic monument which the dwarfs lost because of some feud between wizards.

#### Underground

You begin [underground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80AQW6zqP9E) with a handful of grumpy dwarfs and you need to expand their living area so that they have enough comfort whilst looking for the mystic monument in the temples. You do this by providing mushrooms so there are copious amounts of mushroom beer available to them. You can build bridges, ladders, houses, pubs, storehouses and many other buildings to improve their lives even further. The space underground is of course limited, but by digging you discover new open caves where you can place buildings or grow crops.

#### **Temples**

As the prologue shows, your goal is to eventually get back to the surface, but before the dwarfs can return there they need to restore the mystic monument. Pieces  of the monument are found in old dwarf temples which are basically puzzles you need to solve by flipping switches and exploring the buildings. Besides Parts of the monument you get  new technologies which are mainly there to make everything easier for the dwarfs. I thought those puzzles were difficult because I was little. Well I was wrong.

It still took me a lot of time and several attempts to gather all the stuff in the first temple and to get every dwarf outside again. It is not difficult because of the complexity of the temples, but because those little dwarfs will not stand still. You need 2 or sometimes even more dwarfs to get through the whole thing, but they are a pain to manage. When you direct one dwarf somewhere and leave your other dwarf standing idle for just a second he will go for a walk. So you when you get back to him you cannot find him because he walked back to the entrance or fell off a ramp.

####  Verdict

That leaves me with the question if it Caveland is as good as I remember it? Well it is definitely as difficult as I remember, I am wondering how I had the patience to move those dwarfs around as a child.  The building and digging part is really fun and as you unlock more technologies you can make more interesting things. I think it has lots of similarities with [Terraria](http://www.terraria.org/index2.html), but of course more limited and with dwarfs. I definitely recommend playing this if you have done so back in the nineties, you will not be disappointed.

Since the game is considered 'abandoned ware' I have made it available as a [download here](http://www.legenddiaries.com/other/download-caveland/), where you can also find more screenshots I made. it is playable on windows 8 but I had some crashes and sound issues, so a Windows 95 emulator might be better. Have fun!
