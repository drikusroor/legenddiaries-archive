**This is a new regular feature on Legenddiaries, in which I am going to bore you with the things that kept me busy every month. This can be about the games I played or bought, interesting game news, stuff that kept me from gaming (although I try to limit such trivialities) and I will give a short overview of what has happened on Legenddiaries.** **Because of finals I only managed to produce two posts this month; a look at a retro game named [Caveland](http://www.legenddiaries.com/regular-features/grandpas-retro-games-caveland/) and [chapter 10](http://www.legenddiaries.com/stories/the-milkdrinker-chapter-10/) in the story of a milkdrinker. Luckily I did have some time to play games.**

## Millénaire

The belief in a 1000 year cycle and the coming of a big transformation in society is called '[millenarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism)'. Millénaire is a  Minecraft mod which derives its name from this belief. In this mod you are the change that comes to the randomly generated societies. There are mayan, japanese, hindi and many more types villages that randomly spawn. The purpose of this, is to take away the emptiness of the worlds of Minecraft and make it possible to interact with npc's. These interactions were surprisingly extensive and fun.

It takes time and lots of exploring to find these villages and to do this more effectively my roommate found two other mods to help us with exploring. The first one is a tent mod which does not need much elaboration and the second one is a boat mod. Of course there are boats in Minecraft already, but these come with passenger seats and chests for cargo!

So if you want a break from building and do something else in Minecraft, check the mods below.

##  3 dimensional blinky-thingies

Two weeks ago I finally bought a 3DS. I have wanted one since I saw the trailer of Mariokart 7 and I was saving for one since I heard the Pokemon X and Y announcement. I bought Mario Kart 7 with it, which is the best Mariokart I have played so far. And I got Zelda Ocarina for my birthday. It's awesome to play the old N64 Zelda again  (yes it is a re-make and I am that old) and the 3D effects in Ocarina of time are amazing. When Link turns around, his pointy hat almost touches your nose and little magical blinky-thingies really (well not 'really'.. but it does look like it) come out of the screen. It beats every 3D experience I have had so far.

I also discovered that I now don't have to get a Wii U because there is also a (slim version) of Lego Undercover on the 3Ds. Although it has pretty bad reviews I was amazed at how much of the city and gameplay features were in the 3Ds version. I tested in a game store so I have to wait for a price drop  before I can play it for real (I am also taking donations).

## July

I have no more studying to do since last friday so I will be able to do a lot more fun stuff in the next two months. Beginning with July in which I will probably play the new Sims 3 expansion a lot and see if we, the male virtural dollhouse pwnerers, are being discriminated yet [again](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/discrimination-of-the-male-virtual-dollhouse-pwner/). I also tend to play a lot of Pokemon at the beginning of the summer, although I cannot decide which one. So if you know which one I should play, please let me know in the comments below. Even though I had [earlier doubts](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/cycling-doping-free-since-2001/), I have decided to just watch the Tour de France and forget about all the nasty business. As for Legenddiaries, I am already working on chapter 11 of the milkdrinker and I have plans for another retro game to play.

In the meantime I wish everyone a good summer. If you like to stay up-to-date please like Legenddiaries on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Legenddiaries) or subscribe to get email up-dates.
