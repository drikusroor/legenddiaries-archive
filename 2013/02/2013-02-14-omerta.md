Omerta is the code of silence. Gangsters where to uphold this code by never speaking about illegal business to the authorities.  If you had quarrel with someone you were supposed to solve this by a vendetta, which means killing them and some of there friends and family to make sure the message was received. You would however never tell on them too the authorities.

Omerta is also the name of at least two mafia games. The first one is [a textbased game](http://www.barafranca.com/) which I played a few times in high school. Through text based missions you earned money, weapons and cars. The missions where stories of you raiding, stealing, shooting or smuggling something.  It was fun until you played long enough to get on high level players their radar and they would kill you, kind of discouraging.

This week a game with the same name was released: [Omerta City of Gangsters](http://www.cityofgangsters.com/us/). It is a turn-based strategy game with a monopoly game elements in it. You take over the city just like in [Scarface](http://www.legenddiaries.com/articles/grandpas-golden-oldies-scarface/). You have to raid steal and rob places for mainly booze because it takes place during the prohibition in 1920-1930.  You do this by shooting and buying parts of town.

The shooting part is turned based. When you send your henchmen on a mission and something goes wrong you have to shoot your way through or out. From trailers it looked like the turn-based gameplay you might know from the [Silent Storm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Storm) games, which is pretty awesome.

I started with the story-mode which begins as a tutorial. You have to hire your first henchmen, rob some stores and sell the liquor. Then you do some special jobs and get enough clean money to buy some property. You can turn this property into (illegal) businesses.

Soon you piss off some local crime lord or get to much heat and you get to try out the turn-based combat mode. The first gangsters and police officers go down easy but after 3 or 4 fights it gets ridiculously difficult. I have to admit that it is a bit ambitious to rob a bank with two people, but it was very discouraging.My men survived and were back in business swiftly and I tried some easier jobs. However even the easy jobs are really though and it seems almost impossible to make some real money.

It all goes very slow, which is okay if the gameplay is fun enough to continue without much reward. It is however not. The monopoly part is fine, but the turn-based combat was very disappointing. It was buggy and the AI runs around like they do not care about cover or your men for that matter. Your actions are limited, you can only take cover, shoot and heal yourself. The classes and leveling system are there, but do not make much of a difference.

I stopped playing after several hours because I was not getting anywhere except the hospital or jail. It is not a bad game, but this is more like a game you play on your phone or tablet for half an hour and then go do something really fun. It does not feel like a complete pc game which you have to buy for around 50€. More like something that is for max. 5€ in the app- or playstore. It is worth trying out if you like being a 30's gangster, but I would wait until it is half the price it is now.
