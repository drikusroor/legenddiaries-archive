title: "Next gen consoles the end of used games?"

There are a lot of rumors about the next-gen consoles, which will be announced and maybe even released this year. One of those rumors is particularly worrying: that Microsoft and Sony will block selling used games. They will do this by linking every bought game to a gamers account, or even the console itself. Not very good news.

By doing this they want to force everyone to buy games for full retail price from the stores. Stores like Gamestop will then no longer be able to buy and sell used games for considerably less than the full retail price. While I can understand this from the developers/publishers point of view, this is unfair to consumers. Consumers can resell cars, books, Cd's and what not, so why not games?

The question about reselling digital games has been raised in European court last year. The court [ruled](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-07/cp120094en.pdf) that even though it is digital distribution, consumers should be able to resell their games for which they payed. 

 _"By its judgment delivered today, the Court explains that the principle of exhaustion of the_ _distribution right applies not only where the copyright holder markets copies of his_ _software on a material medium (CD-ROM or DVD) but also where he distributes them by_ _means of downloads from his website"_

This means that if Microsoft and Sony go through with their plans to ban used games, the European law will prohibit it. Origin and Steam already had to alter their services to make it possible for gamers to sell their games to others. It seems likely that Sony and Microsoft will have to comply to this ruling to. They might be able to delay this by clauses in the EULA agreements, the ones we all agree to but never read, but I don't think that will hold in court.

This ruling only applies for Europe. Other parts of the world will have to deal with this anyway, because I have not found a similar law or ruling for countries outside Europe. (_If you did find something similar, please let me know in the comments_). This means Gamestop in the US will not be able to sell used games for the next-gen consoles, regardless of what happened to Origin and Steam.

Like with all rumors, we have to wait until they are confirmed. Until then we can only hope Microsoft and Sony will do nothing of the sort and if they do, the European court will rule in favor of the consumer. However the next-gen could be the end for used games.

If in a worse case scenario Sony and Microsoft will pull it off, will you still buy the next console(s)?
