Sony succeeded to generate a buzz around their next-gen console. Rumors were spread and increased over the last couple of months. What was the new controller going to be like? Will it have a touch pad? What will the next Playstation be called?  Will it be more powerful than the Xbox and when is it going to be announced? The last question was answered first and only a few weeks ago. 20th February was the day Sony was going to make a big announcement. It could be a new Vita or something else that would be lame, but that was unlikely. It had to be the new console. The rumored Orbis would finally be presented to the audience and make an end to all the speculations. But it is not named the Orbis. The fact that '4' also means 'death' in Japanese, did not bother Sony enough to name the new Playstation something else than Playstation 4.

The new Playstion will not aim to be the center of the living room anymore, it will now put the gamer in the center  They intend to do this mainly by focusing on cross platform support and social networking.

Mark Cerny, the lead system architect, says the PS4 will be like a supercharged pc. Which of course sounds cool, but is not really saying anything. The CPU will be a x86 and the GPU will be an enhanced PC video card. The RAM will be 8 Gb, which is nice and it will have a hard drive, shocking. How the PS4 looks is however still a mystery, they only revealed the new controller.

The Dualshock 4 has new features and layout, but is in general the same as the last controller. They did however add a touch pad and a share button. They did not expand on the functions of the touch pad, but the share button was demonstrated. You can now record gameplay and immediately upload it to the internet. This sharing of video content must become as big as the sharing of screenshots is now. With this button it is also possible to broadcast live while you are playing and your friends will be able to comment on your game skills. Not only can they comment, it is also possible for them to take over your controller from their home and get you through tough parts of a game, or show you how you can do it better. I am not sure I will let my friends take over my game, but it is cool that it will be possible.

There were also some launch games announced. Killzone Shadowfall, Driveclub, Infamous Second Son and Knack will launch with the PS4. The first gameplay footage of Killzone was shown and I must say it looks pretty awesome (I believe my opinion was  not clouded by my [Dutch Pride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Games)). The lightning and detail are a huge improvement to the current Playstation 4 and it can compete with current pc games on ultra setting with ease. Driveclub was also highly detailed, I have not seen such detailed cars in a game yet. Of course it is the question how much of this detail will be seen in the actual game.

Other footage that was shown was of the game Watchdogs and the new engines that Capcom and Square Enix are developing. Especially the gameplay of Watchdogs was interesting. We saw a character walking through a city and the world around him was very much alive. The game itself had a very [Enemy of the state](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dvvLzNC3hE) vibe and it is a title definitely worth watching. Last but not least Blizzard announced that Diablo III will come to Ps3 AND Ps4! It will have all the current pc content when it will be released and a split-screen option. It will be possible to play with 4 friends on the couch and hack your way through dungeons, awesome!

Sony showed various tech demos of the possibilities of their new hardware including the old man you see above. A new level of detail and display of emotion will be possible and this will be interesting to see in games like Skyrim.

There was one more feature that was very interesting. The new Ps4 will have integrated Playstation move and with this you will be able to make 3d models. Sony implemented this feature because of this little invention that is the 3d printer. In the future it should be possible to create models on your Playstation which you can then animate on the machine itself or eventually print it with a 3d printer. I wonder if the Ps4 is going to be the machine through which people are going to create 3d models to print, but it is awesome they are anticipating the development of the 3d printer as well.

In the very long live conference of Sony they released more information than I presented here, but the above are the most interesting facts in my opinion. For other information, about the Vita cross-platform for example, you can check the rest of the internet! What remains a big mystery however is how the box that will be the Playstation 4, will look like. Hopefully that (and a lot of next-gen games!) will be announced in the next couple of months.

The Ps4 will be released at the end of 2013.
