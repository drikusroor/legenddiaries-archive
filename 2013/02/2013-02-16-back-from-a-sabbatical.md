I bought Skyrim for my Playstation 3 on 11-11-11. I played with several characters but after 8-10 months I got bored and wanted to play the expansions. As you know that was not possible for Playstation owners until last week. So I switched to pc, started new characters and played Dawnguard, Hearthfire and of course some mods. It is fun to play on pc and definitely better looking. However hundreds of hours I kept thinking about that Nord character on my Playstation, who was missing all the fun of slaying vampires and building his own home. This week his sabbatical was finally over, Dragonborn was finally released for Playstation and the other two expansions will follow shortly.

I find my Nord in Riften at level 56. He is wearing his Thieves Guild armor and dual wields Dawnbreaker (which you could get with a glitch). He is one of the sneaky types, but is also skilled in heavy armor which makes it possible for him to power to a dungeon without sneaking as well.

My Nord is carrying a lot of crap so I put everything away. I only keep my arrows and potions. The stuff I do not want to store I sell to Balimund and I buy some materials to make some nice basic steel armor. I do this because Solstheim will probably be packed with new armor and weapons and I probably want to wear those. That would mean dropping precious armor and weapons to make room in my inventory, so better to drop an iron bow in the middle of nowhere than leave behind my Nightingale bow.

While I am smiting at Balimund's forge, two weird robed dudes come up to me. This must be it, the beginning of Dragonborn! They ask me if I am the Dragonborn, and talk about some dude called Miraak. Then they say I have to die and start attacking me. Before I can even draw my freshly forged steel axe the Riften guards slay the two weirdos. I check their bodies and it appears they were sent here to kill me. I should check out the boat they came with in Windhelm. ![Cultists](images/IMAG0953-1-300x180.jpg)

I take a wagon, although M'aiq might find me lazy, and run to the harbour upon my arrival in Windhelm. The ship captain, Gjalund Salt-Sage, is moping on his ship. Apparently the cultists who tried to kill me drugged the ship crew or something, because they lost a couple of days. He has now promised himself to never go back too Solstheim, but my Dragonborn's deep pockets convince him to bring me too Ravenrock.

I have played Morrowind with the expansion Bloodmoon so this is not only a return of my Nord character, but also my return to Solstheim. When the ship enters the harbour, I immediately recognize the architecture of the East Empire Company colony I build. Strange thing is, it is now mixed with Redoran buildings.

A Dunmer greets when I get off the boat, well ‘greet’ is not the right word because he is quite unfriendly. It has been two centuries but the Dunmer still greet me with ‘outlander’. I wander into the settlement and it is very different than it was but still very familiar.

Since I do not want to spoil anything of the story I will stop here. Dragonborn is however an awesome expansion and we can only hope the next one (rumour has it will be called ‘Redguard’) will be just as good.
