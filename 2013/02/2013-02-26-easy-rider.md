I have been playing World of Warcraft since 2006, not continuously but with big and small breaks. Recently I logged in again and, I am not sure why, bought a Chopper. Turns out it was one of the best in-game decisions I ever made. The [Mekgineer's Chopper](http://www.wowhead.com/item=44413/mekgineers-chopper) is just like every other fast mount, except that it is an awesome bike! When you drive it you instantly get the feeling you should join a biker gang or get a tattoo.

The bike has also has a passenger seat. You can take one person with you, if he or she is in the same party. This discovery resulted in driving around my girlfriend's low level character, which got pretty boring because I had to wait while she was slaying [Murlocs](http://www.wowwiki.com/Murloc) on the beach of Westfall. So I resigned as [personal driver](http://youtu.be/HUlODV1CDJE?t=9m25s) and went on a small road-trip through Duskwood and Stranglethorn Vale.

While I am cruising through the jungle and listening the Easy Rider [soundtrack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMbATaj7Il8), I feel that I should take a trip through whole Azeroth and film it. Luckily the internet would not be the internet if there was not something like that already out there, so I do not have to spend my precious time making a film like that.

Two WoW players took a road-trip on two fine Mekgineer's Choppers through the Eastern Kingdoms and put it on Youtube. They did this for two reasons. First: Choppers are awesome and second: The vanilla Azeroth was soon to be destroyed by the Cataclysm expansion, so this would be a nice trip down memory lane.

They travel from Booty Bay to the northern point of the Eastern Kingdoms and stop at various locations along the way. While doing this you hear pretty decent music, although I did miss 'Born To Be Wild'. Below their awesome journey, all credits go to the two awesome Desperados that made this!
