Morndas the 15th of Morning Star,

It took a couple of days before I was able to write again. So much to do in so little time. On the 7th of Morning Star I arrived in the province of High Rock in order of the late emperor. Yet suddenly I fell into the middle of a cave, forcing me to find and fight my way out. This tired me in such a way I had to recover for several days. Also, I strained my ankle during the fall, of which I still feel the effects.

As of now, I am in the Citadel of Gaersley, on a quest to kill a werewolf. I just applied for a membership of the Fighters Guild, just so I can make a living in the next couple of weeks. A couple of minutes ago I killed two burglars who suddenly appeared behind a wall. They came from this chamber with a torturing device, designed to pierce people with several spikes, while lying on a table made of stone. It is in this room I am writing this journal, whilst preparing for my confrontation with the werewolf.

As you can see, I made a small drawing of myself and the equipment I\`m currently wearing. It´s mostly chain mail as I arrived here without anything but rags. I thus had to look for armor to protect myself. In the cave I fell into, I was able to slay some thieves and burglars, enabling me to wear whatever they were wearing. Mostly chain mail armor as you can see. As for weapons, I\`m currently wielding an ebony dagger. Quite unusual, because I\`m at best when wielding longer blades but because I only have mediocre long blades, I decided to go for quality. Wait... I hear something, it\`s getting closer... I have to go, I hope I can write again soon.

Ainab 'red-mouth' Indala
