From ultimate pro to a bottom rank rookie: that's what upgrading to a new edition in a sports game series does to you. You have to relearn everything from shooting to manoeuvring through the main menu. I tried to keep playing my current version of _NHL_ as long as possible, but with the current sale in the PlayStation Store, I could not resist buying _NHL 15_. Knowing what I was getting into, I started playing _NHL 12_ until _NHL 15_ was done downloading.[![](images/NHL-151-1024x282.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NHL-151.jpg)

Twenty-five Gigabytes and 3 [Stanley Cups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup) later I was ready for the pain that was to come. I started with a quick match, playing with the Canucks against the Anaheim Ducks. The result was 0-8. No biggie, it was my first match after all and the awesome graphics and new commentaries made up for my painful loss. I tried some practice rounds, while admiring the sharp sounds of my skates turning on the ice.

I regained morale and was ready to create my own team in the Ultimate Team mode. I got some good players, perfected my strategies and started the first match. I was up against the Anaheim Ducks again, this time on their turf at the [HONDA Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Center) arena. This was my moment to take revenge for the first loss!

In the first period I did not manage to score, but since my defence was very tight they did not score either. Second period started with my first _NHL 15_ goal, so that felt pretty great. My happiness was not there to last though. I got completely destroyed in the third period. I do not even know what happened any more, after the fifth goal against my team.

For a moment I wished that I just kept playing _NHL 12_, but it was time for my next match. We would be playing home this time and I was confident that the cheers of the home-crowd would bring me a tiny, but very real victory. From the arenas catacombs the opposite team emerged: the Anaheim Ducks. I felt my eye twitching.![NHL 3](images/NHL-31.png)

I did not manage to land one goal. I even lost the fights I started out of frustration. The result after 2 periods was 0-11, so I rage quitted. It had to be my team for sure: ultimate team my @#%.  Time for the real work. In GM mode I got to manage a _professional_ team and a bunch of losers. I dived into a new season with the Pittsburgh Penguins and was confident that the Stanley cup would be theirs this year.

I simulated the time up to the first game-day and the Penguins were matched off against the Ducks. Again. This was no coincidence: those \*ucks were after me. But this time I brought the Penguins and they would be more than a match for these birds of the [Anatidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatidae) family. Except that they weren't. 4-1 for the brothers of goose, read the scoreboard at the end of the third period.![NHL 2](images/NHL-2.png)

I will get my revenge however and then those birds from Anaheim will rue the day that they became a licensed team in _NHL 15_. When that day comes, _NHL 18_ will probably be out already and I will be tempted into buying it and the hatred and pain will start all over again.
