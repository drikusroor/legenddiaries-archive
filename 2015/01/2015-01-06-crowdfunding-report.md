#### In the past two years I have previewed several crowd funding projects that were on Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight. Since 2014 is now behind us I will take a look at the progression of some of these projects and check what we can expect of them this year.

#### [Comic Conquest](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/kickstarter-comic-conquest/)

Comic Conquest is a party-based tactical RPG and was funded with $22,669 on October 23 2013. Sleepy Giant could now finish their game and give the backers what they payed for. Promising updates came in the first month of 2014 and then silence.  A project [being bought by Facebook](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/the-dark-side-of-kickstarter/) might seem a worse case scenario, but a game not getting made at all is really not getting your money's worth.

The website is now offline and no one has heard anything since January 2014. The backers tried to contact the team, but gave up last May and the project seems dead. Sleepygiant is now [Adaptiv.io](http://www.adaptiv.io/) and there is no word about Comic Conquest or games on their website whatsoever. The star-artist Jeff Matsuda is still drawing pretty pictures but for what is unclear. It seems that we have to forget about Comic Conquest, because it's creators certainly have.

#### [Planets³](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/planets%C2%B3-minecraft-in-space/)

Even though Planets³ is a pain to type, it is much more alive than Comic Conquest. Regular development updates are given to the backers through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PlanetsCube) and their [website](http://www.planets-cube.com/) and the progress looks promising. There is a bit of a delay in the release of the pre-alpha, but other than that the team is doing their best to spend their backer's money (over $300,000) accordingly and completing this very ambitious project.

[**Rimworld**](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/kickstarter-rimworld/)

Rimworld was already far beyond it's Kickstarter funding goal when I first wrote about it and Tynan Sylvester has made much progress since. Although the game is still in alpha it has lots of new features and a very steady development process.

I have not had the chance to play any recent versions of the alpha, but if you read the [devblog](http://ludeon.com/blog/) you will get an idea of how much the game has improved an grown over the past year. Even though there is no word on a possible release date yet I have no doubt that Rimworld will be completed. Rimworld is a perfect example of how crowd funding for games should work. You can still back the game and for $30 or more you get instant access to the alpha of the game.

#### [RymdResa](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/steam-greenlight-rymdresa/)

This Steam Greenlightlit project developed by Morgondag is maybe my most anticipated game of this lot. The poetic space journey is still being very much developed and every now and then we get snippets of the development and the occasional cat-picture through their [website](http://rymdresa.morgondag.nu/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Morgondag). There is not much new information however, but the project seems alive and I cannot wait for the first playable version of this game.

 Hopefully we will see more of these projects soon. For now, all the best wishes and indie games in 2015.
