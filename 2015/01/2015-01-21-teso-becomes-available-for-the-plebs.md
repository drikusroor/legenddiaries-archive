The Elder Scrolls Online finally drops its monthly subscription fee and will adopt the buy to play model that we know from Guild Wars. From the start TESO's prices were very steep and only [for the wealthy Imperials](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/imperialeditionteso/) among us. Now that the monthly fee has been dropped, the common folk will also be able to enter the online version of Tamriel.

The monthly fee remains optional though and if you choose to keep paying, you benefit from a ['plus membership'](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/news/post/2015/01/21/your-guide-to-eso-plus-premium-membership). This membership comes with a experience bonus of 10% and a regular income of 'crowns'. I am not sure what these 'crowns' exactly are, but if it is some sort of currency (and I bet some regular in-game money it is) a pay to win situation might develop itself. ![eso 2014-01-12 12-52-56-62](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/eso-2014-01-12-12-52-56-62.bmp)

We will have to wait and see how this 'Elder Scrolls Unlimited' turns out, but a lot of gamers will be happy to see that this great online game will be available for less money and on the Xbox One and Playstation 4. Me and my friends just ordered a copy of the game and will join the Ebonheart Pact on March 17 when TESO Unlimited goes live.
