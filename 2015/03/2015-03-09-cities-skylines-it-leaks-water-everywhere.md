#### Cities: Skylines will be released tomorrow and I cannot wait to get my hands on it. From the dev-diaries and gameplay videos I got the impression that this might be the game we wanted when we bought the last Simcity title. So what is so leaky about it then?

_**Update: Scroll down for some very wet screenshots**_

Well Literally the water, it leaks everywhere. The water simulation system in Cities: Skylines is designed to be very dynamic and flow through the landscape from a higher to a lower point on the map. If you pollute your rivers upstream it will flow all the way down and possibly contaminate your water supplies. While this is a nice feature, it is not what makes the water in Cities Skylines so special.

It's the physics that make the water in this game extraordinary. When you change the landscape and the flow of a river, the water will react to it. If you for instance place a large dam in a river, the water will be stocked up behind it and the water level will rise. This can flood parts of your city if you are not careful enough. In the video below you can see how this worked in the alpha stage of the game and I presume it has only been developed further.

It is of course not the first time this has been done, in games like _From Dust_ the water reacts in a similar way. However, those games evolve around playing with water and is for the first time I have seen so much attention going into the water dynamics in a city building game. I hope the game will allow you to play freely with this element, because I would love to flood one of my cities at a certain point just to see what happens.

I have not been this excited about water in a long time and I am looking forward to play with this particular element when Cities: Skylines releases tomorrow. I will post some screenshots as soon as I manage to build a [polder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polder) city and flood it.

**Edit:** My flooded city! I would have been able to flood it even more if I had more money, but it is a nice disaster nonetheless.
