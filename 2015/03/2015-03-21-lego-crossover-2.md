Lego en games might be the best things that are out there in this wild world without Pokémon. So you can imagine that if those two are brought together you get something that is a potential threat to the definition of the word 'awesomeness'. We have seen this phenomenon become almost real in a [Age of Empire to Lego crossover](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/lego-crossover/), but sadly the Danish overlords have not put this to production (yet). I am almost certain that this is why the guy behind The Guildmaster Studio is using the element of video to bypass these powerful Lego people and spread his Skyrim Lego crossover to the public, although the possibility remains that he did it because he just has awesome skills in making motion capture videos.

  While the sound is a bit off in this first episode, the result is impressive. By using Lego figures and props he recreates the main quest from The Elder Scrolls Skyrim. The landscape and sets almost exact replicas of the in-game world and are part Lego, part clay. Voices, music and sounds effects seem to be taken from the game and even gameplay elements like character creation are dealt with.

  The second episode covers the main quest from Riverwood to the Dragonsreach in Whiterun. The effects and sounds are prefect this time and the creator even put some very nice but subtle jokes in. This is the most recent episode and I cannot wait for the third instalment in which we will probably see the retrieval of a certain dragonstone from Bleak falls barrow.

If you are just as impressed as I am you can follow The Guildmaster Studio [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QLXJcL5nzdGWkVtaCvMkA/feed) and be the first to see his new creations.
