**The webbrowser game [AD2460](http://www.ad2460.com/) goes free to play as of december 7th. In a press-release Per Bauman states that a subscription based business model is not viable with their current player base. With patch 7 the Sci-Fi game will become accessible to all for free and will feature microtransactions.** [](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/c0e75c7d-baa7-4b64-8a22-070a52978313.jpg)

With this decision [Fifth Season](http://www.fifthseason.no/) goes against their previous statement in which they told [Nordic Game Bits](http://nordicgamebits.com/2014/12/30/ad2460-flies-free2play-current/) that a freemium model would not fit their game. However, to keep the sci-fi game fun as a MMO they have to change their business model.

Per Baumann from Fifth Season stresses that AD2460 will not become pay to win:

> Fifth Season has always been very clear in their stance against "pay-to-win" so even though the game now goes “free-to-play” it will have no elements of “pay-to-win”.

The microtransactions that will be added in the next patch will feature facial and graphical commander elements, bounties and War-games. Cosmetic changes will probably not change the gameplay, but the ability to put bounties on other players by paying real money might be more tricky.

_AD2460 is a webbased sci-fi MMO developed by Fifth Season, you can read my review [here](http://www.legenddiaries.com/previewsreviews/review-ad2460/)_
