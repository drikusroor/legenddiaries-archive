#### The void between World of Warcraft expansions is a long bitter darkness and since playing WoW is not exactly free, I do not play the game for almost a year. However, you can play WoW for free through the veteran account status, so I am trying to enjoy myself in this free to play part of WoW. In part #2 of my Veteran Challenge: questing, chasing owls and the Darkmoon Faire.

Playing WoW on veteran status is not as adictive as playing as subscriber so far. I am a bit hesitant in levelling with my Druid and have to really sit down to advance with my veteran challenge, also because there are so many other things I want to play at the moment. I did manage to play for about three hours last week and I advanced to level 10.

**Questing** In the previous post I told you that I would not be using Heirlooms, to get as much out of the levelling experience up until level 20 as possible. I tried the same approach with questing, by reading the actual quests for a change. Maybe you already read the quests, but I only read the 'accept quest' button when levelling. It is some getting used to, but it is actually more fun to quest this way.

It is difficult to keep up reading al the quests text, because force of habit made me click through many of them before I remembered I was supposed to read the quest. After an hour or two I got used to it though and I feel confident that I will be able to do a special blog on questing, in the near future.

**Chasing the owl** When reading al those quests one might forget that not all is accessible to the veteran free-loader. Teldrassil has somewhat of an owl over-population, including very nice owl-pets. They fly up high as soon as you get close and are hard to catch. At least that is what I thought.

The owls do fly away but a simple click when standing right beneath them will trigger a pet battle. That is if you are a subscriber, because pet battles are of limits for non-subscribers. That is a bit of a let down, because I planned on doing a lot of pet battles and related quests during the challenge.

**Darkmoon Faire** Lucky not all trivial elements are for subscribers only; the Darkmoon Faire is accessible in al its mysterious glory. The game tokens are only a few coppers, which makes it affordable to do all the mini-games of the event. I say affordable, because you will find yourself with very limited funds without acces to the auction house or the fat bankaccounts of your alts.

I shot my Druid from a cannon, wacked some gnolls and danced at a concert of Elite Tauren Chieftain. It was a good day.
