#### Last weekend I went to a local Fireside Gathering in Amsterdam, to compete with other Hearthstone players. It was a very long and awesome day, which made me realise several things about the game, my decks and Hearthstone players.

**The players** I was not sure what kind of crowd I could expect, but it turned out to be a fairly mixed company of players. Except for girls: with only 3 female out of the 40 people competing, they were very under represented at this gathering. The ages varied from 16 to about 40 and there was even a 12 year old competing in the competition, who knew way more about Hearthstone than I did.

I had the most fun when playing Lumi (check out her Twitch channel over [here](http://www.twitch.tv/casual_lumi)). Sitting opposite of your opponent brings out a whole other aspect to the game and Lumi made very good use of it by trying to read my thoughts and game plan out loud. Our round game down to a 1-1 matchpoint, at which we had to play our deciding match Druid versus my Mage.

**My decks** I create all my own decks, because that is a big part of the fun I get out of Hearthstone. This is why the casters in the video could not really figure out my decktype, because there isn't one. You can qualify it as a fatigue Mage and my Shaman probably fits the Totem deck type, but there are always a few cards that are out of place.

This has one advantage: no one knows what I am going to play. I noticed that everyone I was playing was focussing on what deck type I had and trying to anticipate my moves. This was often nearly impossible for them, because I threw weird cards on the board. Especially when I played my [Djinni of Zephyrs](http://www.hearthhead.com/card=2925/djinni-of-zephyrs), opponents became pretty nervous.

However, creative decks have a (probably even bigger) downside: they are often not very competitive. My Mage deck you saw in the video, just does not compete very well against the proven pro-decks. Another downside is my lack of knowledge of other decks. I honestly had no idea what a tempo-Mage was up until this weekend. When I had the 12 year old kid explaining it to me, when I realized I have some reading-up to do.

**The game** Most of all this Fireside gathering made me realise how great this game is. Before this weekend I thought I would probably never experience an accessible LAN-party and that for the atmosphere of a game café I had to [travel to China](http://www.legenddiaries.com/special-features/beyond-the-great-fire-wall-gaming-in-china/). Instead Blizzard has succeeded in making a game that makes it incredibly easy to organize an event and play their game together. Not only that, Blizzard actively [encourages](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/fireside-gatherings) people to come together to play Hearthstone and after last weekend I can only recommend any Hearthstone player to grab a chair and sit down by the hearth at a Fireside meetup.
