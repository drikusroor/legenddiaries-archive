#### This week I switched to Ubuntu on one of my computers, to be able to write without the distraction of all the games I have installed on my main computer. So naturally when the installation was done I checked my Steam Library for games I would be able to play.

**Gaming on Ubuntu with Steam** 46 out of the 136 games in my library are playable on Ubuntu, not a bad score. However, not all of them work without problems. Mount and Blade for instance did not start after installing it, Torchlight II did start but was tearing so badly that I could not even create a character. It seemed like gaming on Ubuntu was not going to be easy

However, essentials like Civilization V do work, which guarantee hours of gaming and while my pc cannot run Euro Truck Simulator 2 smoothly, it does run very well on Ubuntu.

**Wrapping things up** Steam games aside, I always want one very particular game on every system I use: Hearthstone. Now you might say for writing purposes its absence would probably be a good thing, but it will probably mean I will just play it on my phone while "writing".

Battlenet is required to play Hearthstone (unlike WoW, still), so you have to find a workaround. Wine is the way to go here and Ubuntu has made it fairly easy to wrap your Windows games into something that Linux understands. PlayonLinux ([terminal commands](https://www.playonlinux.com/nl/download.html)) does this wrapping for you and with Hearthstone it worked perfectly. Steam games are a bit more hassle and while it can be a solution, gaming on Ubuntu remains troublesome with most games.

**Steam OS** Gaming on Ubuntu is not without some trouble, but if you are not to picky on what games you want to play on your Linux system, it can be a viable game station. We can also expect more games coming to Linux in the near future, now that Steam OS is out there. The operating system from Valve is based on Linux, which makes the jump for games to other Linux distributions easier.
