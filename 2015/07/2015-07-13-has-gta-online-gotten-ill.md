GTA Online has been a great success, even though it had a [rocky start](http://www.legenddiaries.com/blogs/unable-to-connect/).  A lot of additional content and of course the long awaited heists were added to the large world of San Andreas. With the recent release on PC and the release on PS4 and Xboxe One, GTA Online also got a graphics update, which made me buy GTA a second time; a decision I do not regret.

Still I find myself struggling when playing online. I often hop into game to play for an hour, and do a couple of multiplayer matches. Whatever I queue for through the quick job function, I often find myself in a user created map. Those can be fun, but a lot of them are just random silliness with lots of jumps in races and deathtmatch obstacles that are in place to annoy players.

I can be the only one who does not want 50 ramps in a race or a tricky parkour track in a Deathmatch map, but I doubt that. When I try to hosts maps I enjoy often no one joins. Even with the event playlists, it took me over 20 minutes to find a game that had more than two people in it and was actually fun.  [![gta o2](images/gta-o2.png)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gta-o2.png)

A part of the problem is of course my lack of friends ([so lonely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EEW-9NDM5k)) that also play GTA Online, but I am probably not the only one who just wants to play a couple of races that are not incredibly frustrating. Maybe there is a really good work-around this, but I have not been able to find it yet.

What do you think about the current state of the matching system in GTA Online, is it working for you? Let me know in de comments.
