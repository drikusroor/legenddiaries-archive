#### Where Xbox already supports remote-play to PC, PlayStation gamers where still bound to their console and TV, except for those few PSVita owners. This might however change very soon since there is not one, but two remote-play apps in development.

A programmer that goes by the name [Twisted](https://twitter.com/Twist3d89)  took it upon himself to provide the Playstation Players with remote play and currently has a alpha version of his program up and running. While [stock](http://tmacdev.com/forum/files/file/3-remote-play-pc-alpha/) remains limited for the time being, the first lucky buyers seem to be very content with the application so far.

On the same day Twisted released his first version of his app, no one less than the Playstation President tweeted that Sony is also working an a remote-play functionality for Windows and IOS. Coincidence?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Some people asked if we plan to provide Remote Play function to PC, and yes, we are indeed working on an official application for PC/Mac. :D</p>— Shuhei Yoshida (@yosp) <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/670077392761716736">November 27, 2015</a></blockquote>What this will mean for Twisted or when Sony plans on releasing there remote-play app remains unclear, but the players will get remote-play one way or the other.
