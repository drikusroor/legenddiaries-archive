I have been [a bit critical](http://www.legenddiaries.com/english/the-dark-side-of-kickstarter/) about crowd funding, because there are very clear examples of what can go wrong. But that does not mean it cannot work. If done right, it bypasses big corporations and projects are funded by people whom are really interested and invested in what the people behind the project (want to) do. This can make things happened that would normally never make it through the corporate system or like WoW Insider.. cease to exist.

WoW Insider was successful; it had lots of readers and a very active community. Still [AOL](http://www.aol.com/?icid=aolcomlogorefreshaol20) decided that WoW Insider was not the way to go and after 10 years of enthusiastic blogging and providing loads of content for WoW-fans, the site was shut down. Actually all of the Joystiq sites would cease operations. If the decision of AOL was justified and really necessary is hard to say. The fact remains that a lot of people were suddenly without a job and that a huge community was left outside in the cold.

The staff was just as surprised as most of the readers and felt that they were not done yet. So on the 3rd of February, four days after they announced that WoW Insider was [logging off](http://wow.joystiq.com/2015/01/30/wow-insider-is-logging-off/), the core ex-staff of WoW Insider launched [Blizzard Watch](http://blizzardwatch.com/).

As the former editor in chief of Wow Insider states here, this new site could only happened if the community pulled through. Through the crowd funding website Patreon the community could pledge money so that the writers could continue providing news, analysis and context about World of Warcraft.

Patreon works differently than for instance Kickstarter. Instead of one big pile of money up front, you pledge a monthly amount to able writers, Youtubers, bloggers and other artists to keep doing what they do best. Blizzard Watch needs $8000 a month to keep the core features and staff on-board. They reached their goal within 6 hours.

In 6 hours the community made it clear that they agreed with the writers of WoW Insider: they were not done yet. Within two days they reached all of their stretch goals and the Patreon counter is currently at $13600. The staff was overwhelmed because they thought that if they would raise enough money, it would at least take them a week or even a month.

Blizzard Watch became real within 6 hours and they will be able to do much more awesome stuff than they were able to do under AOL. Now they have their own funding and are free to spend it on things they think are important and interesting and they are no longer limited by the plans of a larger company. The community gave them the freedom to not only continue doing what they love to do and do best: they can do it even better. As Anne Stickney puts it in the first [Blizzard Watch podcast](http://blizzardwatch.com/2015/02/04/blizzard-watch-episode-1/):

> When you are working under a corporate umbrella, there is only so high you can raise your hands before you hit the roof and we just ditched that.

In a society where many things are run by big corporations it can be very frustrating that there is little you can do to change decisions like AOL took last month. Except that we now have crowd funding and that with a strong community across the world you can actually say: we do not agree with you, we love the content these people create for us and if we can give them the means to do this, we will.
