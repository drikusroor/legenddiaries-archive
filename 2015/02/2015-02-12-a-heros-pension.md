**Almost every WoW player will know and probably hate them: beggars. Players that are to lazy or stupid to make some money themselves and rather just hold their hand up.** **That is the general capitalistic opinion on beggars and I agree. While in the real world inequality is undeniable, in Azeroth everyone can actually make it. Be it as an Orc or Gnome, everyone starts with only the clothes and sword on their backs and is able to earn gold through game-mechanics accessible to all.**

#### **But What if?**

What if not everyone would have the same means in WoW? What if a warrior would be severely wounded and would no longer be able to fight or work the anvil? Varian is probably not very pro-welfare, if you consider the size of the castle that he lives in and the amount of homeless people roaming around in Westfall. Vol'jin is probably busy with repairing Orgrimmar from a recent siege and making press statements that his Horde is not in anyway affiliated with the Iron Horde. So that leaves the wounded warrior with one option: beg.

Since beggars are not very loved in WoW, you probably want to prevent that your main character ends up that way. Some form of backup-money seems the way to go, or at least a savings account for your hero's pension. But how much gold would it take to let your character retire comfortably?

My main is a human male and currently has the means to go to the doctor or dentist when needed, he is very fit and has no particular genetic illness that runs in his family. Based on that information he has a life expectancy of approximately 85, if he does not forget to resurrect when killed. I like him to retire when he is 65, so how much money would he need to sit out the last 20 years of his life comfortably?

#### **Housing**

First thing to consider would be housing. While he has a fine garrison, I have the feeling that people will stop calling him commander very quickly when he just sits by the pond all day and goes to bed at 8:30pm. Also a retirement on the frontiers is probably not something I would go for, I rather have a nice home near Gold Shire in Elwynn Forest: quiet and my favourite pub within walking distance. Now there are no references for determining the price of the land in Elwynn Forest, so I just have to assume that Varian will be Roman about it and grant me a piece of land as a reward for fighting his wars.

The cost of building a house can be calculated now that we have garrisons. I would like to have a house that is approximately the size of a level 3 inn. It is not that big but it will have room for a study and a guest room for when old guildies or grandchildren come to visit. The Lunarfall inn costs 950 gold and a 1000 resources to construct. Also [the plans](http://www.wowhead.com/building=35/lunarfall-inn) have to be bought which cost another 2000 gold.

Now the garrison resources are tricky because I will probably have to buy the resources for gold near Gold Shire. But how much gold is 1 unit of garrison resources worth? Currently you can obtain [Seals of Tempered Fate](http://www.wowhead.com/currency=994) in exchange for several types of currency, including gold and garrison resources. If I use those numbers as the exchange rate (500 gold = 300 resources) then 1 unit is worth 1.67 gold. 1.67 times a 1000 is 1670 gold, which means building a house in Elwynn forest will add up to approximately  4620 gold, if the land is indeed free.

#### Lordaeron Lambic

Now that we know what a roof over my hero's head costs, I'd like to move on to feeding him. Since there is no way of calculating how much calories food contains or how much a retired Azerothian hero requires, I will take the amount of food that roughly represent breakfast, lunch and diner meals. These contain bread  with some Stormwind Brie, mutton chops, ham steak and several beverages so the old man stays hydrated. Now I also like him to be able to visit The Blue Recluse in Stormwind 2 nights a week, to drink some [Lordaeron Lambic](http://www.wowhead.com/item=82343/lordaeron-lambic#comments) with his old buddies and tell war stories to each other. So I reserved some money for that as well.

This all adds up to 20 gold a week, which is 10140 gold a year based on the prices of food and drinks in Gold Shire and Stormwind. This is actually less than I expected and this adds up to 20800 gold for 2o years of retirement. If you want more luxurious foods this will quickly raise the weekly expenses, but for normal meals 3 times a day and a few beers, you do not have to spend more than 20 gold .

#### One retirement please

For a comfortable home and basic meals over the course of 20 years, you should save up a total of 25420 gold. Humans that is, if you want to retire at 65 as let's say a Draenei you need a bit more, since their life-span can reach over 26.000 years. Although retiring voor 25.935 years might be a bit unnecessary and boring.

Have you ever thought of retiring your hero and if so what kind of retirement you would want for him/her? Let me know in the comments!
