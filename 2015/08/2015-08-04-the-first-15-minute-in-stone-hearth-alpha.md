#### Stone Hearth is only in its alpha stage yet and maybe that is why Blizzard is not suing them for copyright reasons, or just because Stone Hearth is a strategy building game and has nothing to do with cards. While the game is in alpha it is already a very playable game and here is what I experienced in the first 15 minutes.

[](http://stonehearth.net/)I picked a spot near a misty mountain in the woods where there are supposed to be numerous minerals and enough wildlife to hunt. My [Cubeworld](https://picroma.com/cubeworld)\-like villagers spawn into existence and the gathering and building can begin. I order my minions to cut through the forest, because there is no such thing as too much wood in games. Other resources seem unavailable for the moment so I just start building the first pre-designed construction: sleeping quarters. [![Stone hearth 1 (wood)](images/Stone-hearth-1-wood.png)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Stone-hearth-1-wood.png)My minions finish the shed in a reasonable amount of time but since I have no idea how to get hold of a carpenter, they have to do without beds for the first night. Everyone seems to be content with sitting around the fire pit , or sleeping outside in the grass. I wonder how long that will last.

While my villagers are asleep I try to figure out how to get a carpenter. I find that I have to promote people, and since I only have tools for a trapper and a carpenter those are the only jobs available. After her hard earned promotion my trapper ventures out into the woods, or what is left of them, to catch some bunnies. My carpenter spends the whole day making beds for everyone and because he is done before dusk, he also creates a hoe for the first farmer in the village.

Farming takes time though and the trapper is not catching anything. Even though raccoons are practically flying around wherever she walks, she brings not a single piece of raccoon jerky home. The crops are not growing very fast either and hunger is really starting to bother my villagers.

Then out of nowhere a caravan stops by. I look for it on the map, but it seems like it is an invisible caravan that I can only communicate with through a trade window. I quickly forgive them their physical absence as they have copious amount of food with them. I sell as much wood as the traders are willing to take and buy copious amounts of food with it.

My villagers feast for what seems like hours and I cannot even wait to see them finish, because my 15 minutes are up.
