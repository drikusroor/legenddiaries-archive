#### I am very happy with the new Hearthstone expansion. I did not care for the robot expansion or the two singleplayer adventures, but The Grand Tournament is  a very good addition to the game. Now would be the moment to support all those adjectives with arguments, but I am not doing that. This is not a review, this is Return of the Shaman.

The first hero I chose was Thrall and I although I have played with all other classes, they do not fit me like the Shaman class does. I enjoy playing it, because I can control the game and there are few specialized decks that the shaman spells and minions do not have some sort of answer to.

First of all because I still miss a lot of cards because I am a f2p player and I did not want to finish the two single player adventures. Not that I would be on the ladder if I did have the cards, I have no illusions: I am a very casual player.

Still, I noticed that the Shaman is the weaker class of the bunch. I found my suspicion confirmed, when I watch some Hearthstone championships. Almost no one was playing a Shaman and if they did, they were definitely not winning.

I still kept playing the Shaman class after my findings, because I play this card game to have fun and relax. However, it is not a good thing if the class you like to play, or any class for that matter, is a bit neglected. That's why I am very happy that The Grand Tournament puts Shamans back in the game.

Only if you get a fire totem this card is a slight disappointment, but you still get good value for your mana. The Tuskarr really strengthens the early play of the Shaman and on top of that it is an awesome walrus.![Tuskarr Totemic](images/Tuskarr-Totemic-218x300.png)

[](http://www.hearthhead.com/card=2610/totem-golem)I am already happy when the Tuskarr draws a mana totem for me, but there is a slight chance that you draw something that will make you dominate the 4th and probably the 5th turn. [Totem Golem](http://www.hearthhead.com/card=2610/totem-golem) is a new addition to the totem bunch. That's right, it's a though minion that is also a totem. You get one overload from playing it, but that still gives you options to play something on turn 4 and you opponent will have a though time beating it that early in the game.![totem Golem](images/totem-Golem-220x300.png)

Now I still have to get my second Totem Golem and I have my eyes on some other Grand Tournament cards, but it is already a great improvement. The games are a bit slowed down in general and with the new cards I get to control the game a lot more.

If I can use the Shaman class more efficiently, the pros definitely will and I cannot wait to see it in action in the upcoming championships.
