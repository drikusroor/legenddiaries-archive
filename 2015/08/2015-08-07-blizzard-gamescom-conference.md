#### Gamescom is a bit to close to E3 to have real big game reveals, but there are always nice surprises like the [Mafia III trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6dgC5RMXRs). Another Conference I was looking forward too was the one from Blizzard, as they did not show much at E3 and would reveal the next expansion at Gamescom. The reveal came earlier than expected, because normally they do these kinds of announcements at Blizzcon in November.

The reveal opened with everything that happened in Warlords of Draenor followed by a trailer of what will happen next in the new expansion:Legion. Players will go back to Azeroth to fend an invasion of the burning legion. Gul'dan is  - not very surprising - not dead but very much active and scheming with demons and what seems like a revived Illidan.  Luckily we get help from a new class: Demon Hunter. With our own little Illidan's we are send off to stop the greatest demon invasion Azeroth has ever know.

These Iliddari are directly linked to Illidan from back in the day and now fight for the good cause. They are a hero class like the Death Knights and will have a similar starting experience, set in the Black Temple from The Burning Crusade. They have horns, tattoos and two specs; tank and dps. The Demon Hunter will have special skills like sensing enemies through walls and the long awaited double jump.

With the new Demon Hunters and our seasoned heroes, we will travel to the Broken Isles and even the Emerald Dream. The Broken Isles are ancient history and are filled with that history from ancient powers, artefacts, dungeons and lore that goes before the lore we saw in vanilla WoW or even Warcraft. An ancient, never seen before elven race for example, who have cities, forts and other supposedly impressive magic and technologies for us to discover and unfortunately destroy.

You will encounter them in the new regions and of course the dungeons, that will have  a more prominent role than in the previous expansion. It seems that Blizzard has listened to the players feedback, that dungeons were sort of obsolete from the moment that Warlords of Draenor moved on to the very focused raid content. I hope they will deliver on this and that I will finally be able to enjoy five-man groups again, as they were once my favourite group mode in World of Warcraft.

The artefacts are focused on class specialization. You will start a quest at the beginning of your Legion adventure and seek out the weapon for your class and specialization. This will give every specialization their own specific storyline, as for instance Frost Death Knights will be looking for some Frostmoune shards. This weapon has its own sort of talent tree that you can level up and customize to your play style. The weapons have various layouts when you level them up and customize them, so you do not have to worry about every paladin running around with an Ashbringer.

While the specific story lines sound awesome, I am still a bit concerned about everyone running around with basically the same weapon.  I guess we will have to wait and see how many variation that will be added over time and hopefully you will be able to transmog them, if you would prefer that, as well. Also many new, unknown weapons are added to a total amount of 36. In the case of feral druids this means that they will not seek out and level up a weapon, but an advanced feral form which will be just as customizable.

The most interesting part for me this presentation were the Class Orders. They are a base of operation for your class and you will be their leader. It will not be like a garrison as you will see other players from the same class there. The locations are tuned to the lore and style of the classes so expect to find you Shamans close to nature and your Warlocks close to demon fire. This base of operations will also play an important role in getting and levelling your artefact.

Check the complete reveal trailer below and I am sure more information will be revealed in the coming weeks and months.
