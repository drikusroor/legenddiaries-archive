Chatroulette is a well known experience among people below thirty, often executed when drunk or really really bored. It consists of random people showing up on your screen, with whom you have very superficial and short conversations. Expect for that one time you talked to that girl in France all night, which you hope to find once again. But every time you think it will be her it's a very hairy guy without underpants.Â Now if that is something you find appealing, you might have been around to experience a very interesting Chatroulette session.

A group of people with a very large garden - which contains a disturbing amount of chapels - created a FPS shooter that started once they connected to someone through Chatroulette. The players could command the game character and play through a zombie filled level with even a boss fight at the end. The result is a video that proves that the internet can be a wonderful place.
