As everyone on the internet knows by now the Steam Summersale has started and Valve went out of their way to call it an actual 'monster sale'. A fitting description, as almost the entire Steam catalogue is on sale. With over 90 games in my library and a pc that cannot really play the most recent AA-titles, I figured there would not be that much left for me to buy. Silly me.[![Gabe](images/Gabe.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gabe.jpg)

I filled my shopping-cart with games and reached an amount of €50 within 10 minutes. Way more than I wanted to spend. So I had to go through the familiar, but painful process of elimination. The first casualty was Wargame_,_ while very interesting I could do without for now. The next one was more painful: The Bannersaga. While €14,99 is not that much for a supposedly awesome title, it was one I had to eliminate. Maybe it will drop in price even more - one should actually not buy non-daily offers on the first day of a Steam sale, if one has self control - and will I finally be able to play with Vikings and their banners.

The pain of elimination subsided fairly quickly, once I checked out the seven games I that remained: Portal (backlog), Sacred Gold (Expect a [Nostalgia](http://www.legenddiaries.com/?s=nostalgia) post soon), Space Pirates and Zombies (for obvious reasons), Half Life 2 (was somehow missing from my Library), Hotline Miami (backlog), Borderlands 2 GOTY (co-op reasons) and Evoland (game-history-inception).![Steam Summersale 2015](images/Steam-Summersale-2015-1024x251.png)

After my purchase I noticed that I now had more than a hundred games in my Steam library. Since I bought seven at the same time it is hard to say which made me pass that milestone, but I like to think it's Half Life 2. That game made me make a (now lost) Steam account in the first place, many years ago.

I now have a total of  103 games and I doubt that number will not increase before the end of the Steam summersale. I must say it feels a bit daunting to own that many digital games, because I still have to finish so many of them. Have you ever felt the same looking at your Steam library? Let me know in the comments how many games you have and if you think you will ever be able to play them all.
