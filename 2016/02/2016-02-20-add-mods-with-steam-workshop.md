#### Adding mods to most Steam games is very easy with the Workshop. Still, it might be easily overlooked or unfamiliar if you're used to old fashion copying and editing gamefiles. After reading this tutorial, the Steam Workshop will have no more secrets for you.

Back in the day we didn't have a Steam Workshop, or handy mod installers like Nexus Mod Manager. You had to scrap together files from different sites and then you had to be lucky to put them in the right directory. But enough grandpa talk: Let's talk shop.

#### **Where is the Steam Workshop**

The Workshop is on Steam, the Steam Workshop does not work on non-Steam games. You can peruse the Workshop in the browser or in the regular PC Steam program. If you want to acces it, you will have to go to your **library** and select the game you want mods for. [![Steam Workshop library](images/Steam-Workshop-library.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Steam-Workshop-library.jpg)You can also go to **Community** on the top and select the **Workshop** there. On the website this is the only way to get there. The Workshop is not accessible through the mobile app.

#### **Finding mods in the Workshop**

The featured mods always show you the **most popular mods** on Steam and are a great source for mods to change up your game. **Most recent mods** are only interesting if you want to stay on top of things and check the workshop every day. If you are looking for something particular you can just use the search function, but with mod heavy games you will want to use the **tags** on the right.[![Steam Workshop Cities Skylines](images/Steam-Workshop-Cities-Skylines.jpg)](http://www.legenddiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Steam-Workshop-Cities-Skylines.jpg)

#### **Workshop tags**

Cities Skylines has thousands of mods and it's not the only game that has a enormous mod community. These games have their mods sorted in tags, so if you are looking for maps you only have to check one Cities Skylines sections without having to pass 4000 kinds of tree props.

#### **What happens when you subscribe**

Steam wants to avoid every suggestion of you doing any download work, so the only thing you will have to do is hit the **+Subscribe** button when you have found a mod to your liking. It will download and install it immediately, so the next time you start the game the added content should be there. With larger mods or if you have a slower internet connection, you might want to check downloads before starting your game and see if there is nothing downloading.

#### **Updating Workshop mods**

If a mod is updated by the creator, Steam will automatically apply the update to your gamefiles. The only times you should be concerned with updates yourself is if the game gets an expansion or update, because then mods might not be compatible any more.

#### **Remove Steam Workshop mods**

Removing mods from your game is just as easy as installing them, just hit the **unsubscribe** button in the workshop. You can also see all the mods you installed for a particular game in a mod overview, but it can be a bit difficult to find. Go to the workshop for the game in question and select **browse** below the games banner at the top.

Select **subscribed items** and you will see all the mods you have installed for that game.

Also do not forget that most games offer in-game mod options, so you can enhance your game experience further.
