#### I still need to finish Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, but most trainers will be happy to know that Nintendo announced the next Pokémon games at Nintendo direct: Pokémon Sun and Moon.

As always the new Pokémon generation arrives in a pair and instead of choosing a colour or a stone; Nintendo moved to space for inspiration of new Pokémon game names. There were already rumours about a lunar and star themed Pokémon generation, but Nintendo has confirmed the new games during their [Nintendo Direct presentation](https://www.nintendo.nl/Divers/Nintendo-Direct/Laatste-Nintendo-Direct/Nintendo-Direct-698557.html) this afternoon.

**Over the moon**

A journey to the actual moon seems unlikely - or lethal in case of the sun - but nothing has been announced about the story or Pokémon that will be featured in Pokémon Sun and Moon yet. A mega evolution of Solrock and Lunatone seems very plausible though. Pokémon Sun and Moon will release late 2016.

**20th** **Anniversary**

The announcement comes just before the 20th year anniversary of the first Pokémon games on saturday. On the 27th Nintendo will release remakes from Pokémon Blue, Red and Yellow in the Nintendoshop for 2DS and 3DS. You will be able to transfer Pokémon from the remakes to the Pokémon bank and thus to other Pokémon games, including the upcoming Sun and Moon games.

If you want to feel old or catch up on Pokémon history, you can check a complete Pokémon timeline on the [20th anniversary website](http://www.pokemon20.com/en-us/).
