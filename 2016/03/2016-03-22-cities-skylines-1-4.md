**Cities Skylines has a new update. 1.4 hit steam today and brings canals, landscaping and rocks to the city builder. You can dive into 1.4 right now, with or without expansion packs.** 

#### Landscaping

Landscaping was already possible with the new level editor that came with Snowfall, but in 1.4 you will be able to do it while managing a city. You can create mountains, forests and other natural elements in and around you cities. Important note: because of the new landscaping tools pathways and tree props have been moved from decoration to landscaping.

**Canals**

With mods we have already seen a lot of cities with complex water systems, but with 1.4 you will be able to manage water in different ways with the vanilla game. So if you want to build a Venetia or a replica of Amsterdam: you are free to build new water ways in Cities Skylines 1.4.
